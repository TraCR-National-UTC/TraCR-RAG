harm to the individuals whose personal in formation has been breached.

not later than 60 days after determination of the breach of security, except in the following 
situations:  
(1)  A shorter time is required under federal law.  
(2)  A law -enforcement agency determines that the notice will impede a criminal investigation 
and such law -enforcement agency has made a request of the person that the notice be delayed.

notice will not compromise the criminal inve stigation and so notifies the person of such 
determination.

not, through reasonable diligence, identify within 60 days that the personal information of 
certain  residents of this State was included in a breach of security, such person must provide 
the notice required by subsection (a) of this section to such residents as soon as practicable 
after the determination that the breach of security included the personal  information of such 
residents, unless such person provides or has provided substitute notice in accordance with § 
12B-101(5)d. of this title.  
(d)  If the affected number of Delaware residents to be notified exceeds 500 residents, the person 
required to p rovide notice shall, not later than the time when notice is provided to the resident, also
