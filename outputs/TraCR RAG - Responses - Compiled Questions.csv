Most states define critical infrastructure in the context of cybersecurity as systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital that their incapacity or destruction would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination of those matters. These definitions often include sectors such as energy, financial services, healthcare, transportation, government facilities, and information technology, among others. States emphasize the importance of safeguarding these critical systems and assets against threats, ensuring their availability, integrity, and security to protect the well-being of the state and its residents. They also focus on identifying vulnerabilities, responding to incidents, and maintaining resilience in the face of evolving cybersecurity challenges.",

State cybersecurity regulations accommodate the needs and concerns of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) compared to larger corporations by tailoring the cybersecurity programs based on risk assessments that consider factors such as the size and complexity of the licensee, the nature and scope of their activities, including the use of third-party service providers, and the sensitivity of the nonpublic information. Licensees are required to develop comprehensive written information security programs designed to protect nonpublic information, assess risks, and implement appropriate security measures based on their business objectives and risk strategies. These regulations provide flexibility and allow for different levels of compliance based on the covered entity's regulatory status, ensuring that the requirements are commensurate with the size and complexity of the licensee's activities. SMEs can align their cybersecurity programs with specific industry-recognized frameworks, which may be more feasible for them to implement, while larger corporations must adhere to the entirety of specific laws or regulations, ensuring a higher level of cybersecurity standards. Additionally, the regulations emphasize the importance of adjusting security measures according to the licensee's size and activities, while requiring third-party service providers to implement appropriate security measures to safeguard information systems and data.",

New Jersey:
Summary:
New Jersey Legislation code N.J. Stat. § 52:17B-193.3 mandates that public agencies and government contractors in New Jersey must report cybersecurity incidents to the New Jersey Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness within 72 hours. The office is responsible for receiving and maintaining these incident notifications, establishing reporting capabilities, and ensuring confidentiality. Submitted notifications are confidential, not subject to public records act provisions, and may be shared with law enforcement authorities. The procedures align with the federal Cyber Security Information Sharing Act of 2015.

Based on the provided contexts, limitations in the regulations regarding cross-border data transfers and international cooperation in cybersecurity matters exist in various legislations. Some key points include:

1. The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) states that data transfers must meet specific conditions and be justified. Data can only be transferred to countries providing an adequate level of data protection.
2. The Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA) of 2015 highlights limitations in regulations regarding cross-border data transfers and international cooperation in cybersecurity matters.
3. The European Union Cybersecurity Act Regulation (2019/881) emphasizes the importance of international cooperation in cybersecurity while acknowledging existing limitations.

These legislations stress the necessity to address these restrictions to facilitate effective collaboration and information sharing globally.",

Based on the provided contexts, gaps in the regulations concerning employee training and awareness programs leaving organizations vulnerable to insider threats have been identified in various legislations. For example, according to California Vehicle Code § 2328.5, there are challenges concerning employee training and awareness programs for organizations, with certain identified gaps in cybersecurity frameworks for transportation organizations. Insider threats can exploit these gaps, leading to potential security risks and vulnerabilities for organizations. Similarly, the House Report No. 113-194 highlights that insider threats are a continuing concern due to gaps in regulations concerning the training and awareness programs of employees, which leave organizations vulnerable to insider threats. Additionally, according to Transport Law § 17-2607, gaps in the regulations concerning employee training and awareness programs have been noted, which could leave organizations vulnerable to insider threats.

Overall, various legislations indicate that there are gaps in regulations concerning employee training and awareness programs, potentially leaving organizations vulnerable to insider threats.",

The term ""liability"" in autonomous vehicle operations involves determining responsibility for potential liabilities arising from the operation of the vehicle. According to California Vehicle Code Division 16.7, Chapter 1, Article 1 § 38750, liabilities stemming from the operation of an autonomous vehicle are typically attributed to the manufacturer or designer of the vehicle. Additionally, the legislation requires that the owner of the autonomous vehicle maintain an insurance policy covering any potential liabilities that may arise. Liability is prescribed by the manufacturers of autonomous vehicles, and liabilities with respect to the use or operation of autonomous vehicles are determined in accordance with applicable state and federal statutory and common law, including the California Evidence Code. Manufacturers seeking permits for testing autonomous technology on public roads must obtain a permit from the Department of Motor Vehicles and are liable for any damage caused by autonomous technology failure. Liability for accidents involving vehicles equipped with autonomous technology is addressed, making manufacturers liable for any damages caused. Manufacturers retaining liability for vehicle defects in certain automation levels and the operator assuming liability in other levels. Liability for incidents involving autonomous vehicles is apportioned among the manufacturer, technology provider, operator, or other involved parties. It is crucial to establish clear guidelines for liability to ensure accountability and fair compensation for damages in autonomous vehicle operations.",

The laws in place that safeguard a person's credit card details, location tracking, biometric information, and financial records while using services from an autonomous vehicle include provisions related to data privacy. Entities must disclose breaches of unencrypted personal information that compromise security following discovery. Encryption is defined as transforming data into a form with low probability of assigning meaning without a key. The Autonomous Vehicle Cybersecurity Act (AVCA) provides safeguards for credit card details, location tracking, biometric information, and financial records while using services from an autonomous vehicle. The Consumer Privacy Protection Principles provide guidelines on safeguarding data, including credit card details, location tracking, biometric information, and financial records, while using services from an autonomous vehicle. The law also prohibits the intentional retention of specified information like driver license number, social security number, and financial services account number to safeguard personal information. Additionally, manufacturers of autonomous vehicles are required to follow certain guidelines to protect personal information, including credit card details and biometric information, from unauthorized access.",

Summary:
According to California Civil Code § 1714.45 - Liability for Hack of Automated Vehicles, the manufacturer of an automated vehicle is not liable for damages caused by unauthorized access to the vehicle's system through a wireless connection by an external person, provided they complied with applicable laws during manufacture. However, the manufacturer may be held liable for damages resulting from their failure to implement reasonable security measures against unauthorized access. The liability provisions do not apply to driverless-capable vehicles not operating in automated mode, and manufacturers must still comply with federal statutes and regulations. If a conflict arises between state and federal laws, the federal regulation takes precedence. Additionally, there are limitations on the timeframe for bringing legal actions against manufacturers related to alleged damages from hacking activities on automated vehicles.
