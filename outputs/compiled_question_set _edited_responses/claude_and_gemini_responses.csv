The relevant law in Georgia is the Georgia Personal Identity Protection Act (GPIPA), which was enacted in 2005 and has been amended several times since then. Here are the key reporting requirements under Georgia legislation:

1. Notification Trigger:
A data breach notification is required when there is an unauthorized acquisition of an individual's electronic data that compromises the security, confidentiality, or integrity of personal information.

2. Personal Information Definition:
In Georgia, personal information is defined as an individual's first name or first initial and last name in combination with one or more of the following:
- Social Security number
- Driver's license number or state identification card number
- Account number, credit card number, or debit card number, if combined with any required security code, access code, or password that would permit access to an individual's financial account
- Account passwords or personal identification numbers (PINs) or other access codes
- Any of the above items when not in connection with the individual's name if the information compromised would be sufficient to perform or attempt to perform identity theft against the person whose information was compromised

3. Timing of Notification:
The law requires notification to be made in the ""most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay."" However, it does not specify a exact time frame.

4. Method of Notification:
Notification can be provided by one of the following methods:
- Written notice
- Telephone notice
- Electronic notice (if consistent with E-SIGN Act provisions)

5. Substitute Notice:
If the cost of providing notice would exceed $50,000, the affected class of individuals exceeds 100,000, or there's insufficient contact information, substitute notice may be used. This involves:
- Email notice (if email addresses are available)
- Conspicuous posting on the entity's website
- Notification to major statewide media

6. Contents of Notification:
While the law doesn't specify exact content requirements, the notice should generally include:
