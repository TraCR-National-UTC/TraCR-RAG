2,How do most states define critical infrastructure in the context of cybersecurity?,"According to Pennsylvania Statutes, Annotated by LexisNexis® 40 Pa.C.S. § 4513:
(a) Requirement for implementation and objectives. Each licensee shall develop, implement, and maintain a comprehensive written information security program based on the licensee’s risk assessment that contains administrative, technical, and physical safeguards for the protection of nonpublic information and the licensee’s information systems. It should be designed to protect against any threats or hazards to the security or integrity of nonpublic information and the information systems, including unauthorized access to or use of nonpublic information that minimizes the likelihood of harm to a consumer.","According to Legislation code S.C. Code Ann. § 38-99-20, critical infrastructure is defined as services that pose an imminent threat to the provision of wide-scale critical infrastructure services, national, state, or local government security, or the lives of the country's, state's, or local government's residents. This definition is outlined within the National Cyber Incident Response Plan of the United States Department of Homeland Security, which categorizes severity levels from 1 to 5 based on the impact and potential risks involved.","In the context of cybersecurity, most states define critical infrastructure as systems or assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the state that their incapacity or destruction would have a debilitating impact on security, economic security, public health, or safety, national security, or any combination of those matters.","According to Okla. Stat. Tit. 63, §2048:
Critical infrastructure is defined as systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to a state that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have a debilitating impact on security, economic security, public health or safety, or any combination of those matters.","According to Wis. Stat. § 601.952, most states define critical infrastructure in the context of cybersecurity by implementing necessary security measures such as placing access controls on information systems, managing data, personnel, devices, systems, and facilities, restricting physical access to nonpublic information, encrypting nonpublic information, adopting secure development practices for applications, utilizing effective controls including multifactor authentication, implementing regular testing and monitoring of systems, including audit trails, protecting against information destruction, loss, or damage, developing secure disposal practices for nonpublic information, designating a responsible party for the information security program, staying informed regarding emerging threats, including cybersecurity risks in enterprise risk management, utilizing reasonable security measures for information sharing, providing cybersecurity awareness training, monitoring, evaluating, and adjusting the information security program, developing an incident response plan, exercising due diligence over 3rd-party service providers, and oversight by board of directors.","Most states define critical infrastructure in the context of cybersecurity as the systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, that are vital to the state such that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have a debilitating impact on security, economic security, public health, or safety, or a combination of those matters. This definition includes various key sectors such as energy, transportation, communications, financial services, and healthcare. Each state outlines specific guidelines and frameworks to protect these critical infrastructures and ensure their security and integrity. Some states also emphasize the importance of risk assessments and the implementation of comprehensive written information security programs with administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect nonpublic information and information systems.","In the context of cybersecurity, most states define critical infrastructure as systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the state that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have a debilitating impact on security, economic security, public health, or safety.
