5,How do states address cybersecurity risks associated with cloud computing?,"States address cybersecurity risks associated with cloud computing by requiring licensees to develop, implement, and maintain a comprehensive written information security program based on the licensee's risk assessment. This program must contain administrative, technical, and physical safeguards for the protection of nonpublic information and the licensee's information system. Additionally, licensees must protect against threats in each relevant area of operations, provide cybersecurity awareness training to personnel, and annually assess the effectiveness of security safeguards. Licensees are also mandated to include cybersecurity risks in their enterprise risk management process, develop incident response plans, and promptly respond to cybersecurity events.
