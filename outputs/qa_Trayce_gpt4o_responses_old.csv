1,Does Delaware require entities to notify the state attorney general or other governmental agency in the event of a data breach?,"Yes, Delaware requires entities to notify the state attorney general in the event of a data breach. According to the Delaware Data Breach Notification Law (6 Del. C. § 12B-101), any person or entity that conducts business in Delaware and owns, licenses, or maintains personal information must notify the Delaware Attorney General if a breach of security involving personal information occurs. The notification must be made as soon as possible, but no later than 60 days following the discovery of the breach, unless a shorter time frame is required by federal law.

In addition to notifying the attorney general, affected individuals must also be notified if their personal information has been compromised. If the breach affects more than 500 residents, the organization is required to provide notice to the attorney general detailing the number of affected individuals.

If the entity determines that misuse of information is unlikely, notice to the attorney general and affected individuals may not be necessary, but the decision and the reasons must be documented in writing and maintained for five years."

4,Under what circumstances must disclosure of a data breach be made in North Dakota?,"In North Dakota, disclosure of a data breach must be made under the following circumstances, as outlined in North Dakota Century Code § 51-30:

Unauthorized Access to Personal Information: Notification is required when a data breach involves the unauthorized acquisition of unencrypted computerized data that materially compromises the security, confidentiality, or integrity of personal information maintained by the entity.

Third-Party Data Maintainers: If a third party maintains computerized data on behalf of another entity and experiences a breach, they must notify the owner or licensor of the information immediately following the discovery of the breach. The owner or licensor is then responsible for notifying the affected individuals.

Timing of Notification: Notification must be made in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, consistent with the needs of law enforcement or measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the integrity of the data system.

Exceptions for Law Enforcement: Notification may be delayed if a law enforcement agency determines that it would impede a criminal investigation. However, once law enforcement indicates that notification no longer poses such a risk, the notification must be made as soon as possible.

Notification to the Attorney General: If the breach affects more than 250 North Dakota residents, the entity must also notify the North Dakota Attorney General.

Personal Information is defined in North Dakota law as an individual's first name or first initial and last name in combination with any one or more of the following data elements, when either the name or the data elements are not encrypted, redacted, or otherwise altered by any method or technology in such a way that the data elements are unreadable:

Code Ann. § 47-18-2107). Entities that experience a data breach must notify affected individuals using one of the following methods:

Substitute notice must consist of all the following:

In Ohio, failure to comply with the data breach notification requirements is primarily handled through civil penalties and enforcement by the Ohio Attorney General under the Ohio Revised Code § 1349.19.
