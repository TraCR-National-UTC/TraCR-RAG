inform the consumer, without delay and at the latest within the time period permitted of 
response by this section, of the reasons for not taking action and any rights the consumer may 
have to appeal the decision to the business.
(3)If requests from a consumer are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of 
their repetitive character, a business may either charge a reasonable fee, taking into account the 
administrative costs of providing the information or communication or taking the action

the personal information, the business does not have actual knowledge, or reason to believe, that 
the third party intends to commit such a violation.

(1)Reidentify or otherwise link information that, in the ordinary course of business, is not 
maintained in a manner that would be considered personal information.
(2)Retain any personal information about a consumer if, in the ordinary course of business,
