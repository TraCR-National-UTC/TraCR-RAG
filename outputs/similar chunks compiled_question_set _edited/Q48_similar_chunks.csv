A.  Actual or threatened misappropriation may be enjoined.  On application to the court, the court 
shall terminate an injunction if the trade secret has ceased to exist, but the court may continue the 
injunction for an additional reasonable period of time in order to eliminate commercial advantage 
that otherwise would be derived from the misappropriation.
B.  In exceptional circumstances an injunction may condition future use on payment of a 
reasonable royalty for no longer than the period of time for which the use could have been 
prohibited.  Exceptional circumstances include, but are not limited to, a material and prejudicial 
change of position before acquiring knowledge or reason to know of misappropriation that renders 
a prohibitive injunction inequitable.
C.  In appropriate circumstances, affirmative acts to protect a trade secret may be compelled by 
court order.

1798.145.

out preference signal cannot unfairly disadvantage another business.

easy to use by an average consumer and does not require that the consumer provide 
additional information beyond what is necessary.

presupposing that intent.
(iv)Ensure that the opt-out preference signal does not conflict with other commonly 
used privacy settings or tools that consumers may employ.
(v)Provide a mechanism for the consumer to selectively consent to a business’s sale of 
the consumer’s personal information, or the use or disclosure of the consumer’s sensitive 
personal information, without affecting the consumer’s preferences with respect to other 
businesses or disabling the opt-out preference signal globally.
(vi)State that in the case of a page or setting view that the consumer accesses to set the 
opt-out preference signal, the consumer should see up to three choices, including:
(I)Global opt out from sale and sharing of personal information, including a 
direction to limit the use of sensitive personal information.
(II)Choice to “Limit the Use of My Sensitive Personal Information.”
(III)Choice titled “Do Not Sell/Do Not Share My Personal Information for Cross- 
Context Behavioral Advertising.”
(B)Issuing regulations to establish technical specifications for an opt-out preference signal 
that allows the consumer, or the consumer’s parent or guardian, to specify that the consumer 
is less than 13 years of age or at least 13 years of age and less than 16 years of age."
