(1)  The general assembly hereby finds and declares that:  
(a)  Cyber threats have continued to grow in significance, scale, scope, and sophistication in 
the past several years;  
(b)  A dramatic increase in the number of cyber attacks against public, private, a nd nonprofit 
entities and individual citizens, coupled with inadequate resources to respond to such attacks, 
have made cybersecurity a top priority;  
(c)  Colorado is well -suited to serve as a location for comprehensive cross -sector and interstate 
strategy  to support the response against these attacks and the education and training needed to 
prepare government and private sector leaders to respond to these attacks;  
(d)  It is in the state’s interest to support a partnership of academics and systems excelle nce at 
the university of Colorado at Colorado Springs and other institutions of higher education that 
can leverage the military, federal, state, and local government, and private sector assets in 
Colorado to support the cybersecurity of our state and local  governments and to support the 
cybersecurity of federal partners and other states and local governments across the country; 
and  
(e)  It is also in the state’s interest to support such a partnership as a tool to ensure that 
Colorado’s private sector is better prepared to respond to threats and in turn make Colorado a 
stronger hub for the cyber industry and the commercialization of cyber technology.  
(2)  The general assembly further finds and declares that the intent of this part 19 is to identify 
specific actions to define and improve cybersecurity, including the creation of a Colorado 
cybersecurity council, coordinating cyber operations  centers, establishing or expanding cyber 
higher education programs to promote education, training, and workforce development for 
cybersecurity, establishing a secure environment for research and development, and establishing a 
revenue source to support su ch efforts.
