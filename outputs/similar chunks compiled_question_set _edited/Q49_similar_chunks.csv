Compulsory motor vehicle liability security (§§ 32:861 — 32:868)  
 
§ 32:863.2. Notification of the cancellation or issuance of security; penalties; database 
development.   
 
A.   
(1)  All entities providing security in compliance with R.S. 32:861 et seq., hereinafter referred 
to as “security providers”, whether admitted or nonadmitted (surplus line underwriter) 
insurance companies providing automobile liability policies, or sales representatives or agents 
of surety companies issuing motor vehicle liability bonds, or the state treasurer holding 
deposits, shall notify the secretary of the effective dates of each liability policy, liability bond , 
deposit, or other security within fifteen business days from the date that notice of such policy, 
bond, deposit, or other security was issued by the security provider.  
(2)  Except as otherwise provided for motor carriers in R.S. 32:900(M), in addition, all such 
security providers shall notify the secretary when any policy, bond, deposit, or other item of 
security is terminated, withdrawn, canceled, lapsed, or otherwise made ineffective within 
fifteen business days from the date that notice of the securit y becoming ineffective was issued 
by the security provider.  
(3)  Beginning January 1, 1990, the information required by this Section shall be in the form 
required by the secretary, who may require by regulation such information as the driver’s 
license numb er of the owner or lessee of the vehicle and of the named insureds, together with 
the complete vehicle identification number and a description of each vehicle.  
(4)  The information required by this Section shall be in the form required by the secretary, 
who may require by regulation such information as the driver’s license number of the owner or 
lessee of the vehicle and of the named insureds, together with the complete vehicle 
identification number and description of each vehicle.  
(5)  If any cancellation of a motor vehicle liability policy occurs at the request of the insured, 
the insurer is not obligated to cancel such policy earlier than ten days prior to actual receipt by 
the insurer of such request.  
(6)  If any cancellation of a motor vehicle liability  insurance policy occurs as a result of the 
rescission or other cancellation of the sale of the motor vehicle on which the policy is issued, 
the insurer shall notify the secretary of the cancellation and the circumstances of the"

La. R.S. § 32:863.2  
 Trayce Hockstad   (2)  If the person to whom the notice is addressed is able to show that the insurance or other 
security was canceled for a legitimate reason, the secretary shall take no administrative action 
against that person. Legi timate reasons for cancellation of insurance or other security shall 
include but shall not be limited to the transfer of ownership of the vehicle or the surrender of 
the license plate of the formerly insured vehicle. If the vehicle is sold within ten calen dar days 
after the date liability security on the vehicle was cancelled or its license plate is surrendered 
within ten calendar days of the date of notice sent pursuant to Paragraph (1) of this Subsection, 
no administrative action shall be taken. The trans fer of ownership of the vehicle may be 
established by presenting to the secretary a copy of the title transfer or a copy of the act of sale, 
donation, exchange, surrender to a salvage yard, or other transaction.  
(3)  If the original of the document present ed as proof of transfer of ownership has not been 
notarized, the authenticity of the document may be established by an affidavit executed by the 
person to whom the notice is addressed in which that person recites the circumstances of the 
transfer of owners hip of the vehicle and attests to the truthfulness and accuracy of the 
document presented as proof of transfer of ownership.  
F.   
(1)  The secretary shall formulate criteria to develop and initiate a request for proposals to 
procure and implement a real -time system to quickly and accurately identify and verify the 
existence of motor vehicle insurance or other security required in compliance with the Motor 
Vehicle Safety Responsibility Law using advanced telecommunications and computer 
technology.  
(2)  The c riteria established by the secretary shall be developed only after consulting with an 
advisory group consisting of the commissioner of insurance or his designee, the superintendent 
of state police or his designee, the executive director of the Louisiana Hi ghway Safety 
Commission or his designee, and five additional members, one representing the American 
Insurance Association, one representing the Property Casualty Insurance Association of 
America, one selected from a list of names submitted by the three ins urers with the largest 
market share of automobile insurance in Louisiana, one from the Louisiana Association of Fire 
and Casualty Companies, and one from the Louisiana Independent Agents Association.  
(3)  The request for proposal shall require participants  to develop a system that allows real -
time access to state and local law enforcement officials allowing them to obtain the status of 
the existence of motor vehicle insurance or other security required in this state as provided in 
the Motor Vehicle Safety R esponsibility Law.  
(4)  The system developed pursuant to this Subsection may initially be implemented by the 
secretary as a six -month pilot program to be developed and implemented statewide upon 
expiration of the six -month period.  
(5)  The secretary shall require such information as may be necessary from automobile insurers 
or their representatives and the state treasurer as is needed to assist the contractor in 
developing the system as such relates to the cancellation or issuance of motor vehicle liability  
security or deposit of sufficient security with the state treasurer in order to operate a motor 
vehicle in this state.

maintain the security required by law.  
B.  When a security provider does not provide the deputy secretary of public safety services of the 
Department of Public Safety and Corrections with  the information required by this Section within 
the time limits set forth in this Section, the insurance company, sales representative or agent, state 
treasurer, or other provider shall pay a late fee of not more than fifty dollars per policy, bond, or 
deposit, or other security item concerning which information is not supplied. If the security 
provider has reported this information for a policy, bond, deposit, or other security item for a 
commercial motor vehicle in an untimely manner, the deputy secretar y shall impose the late fee 
unless the deputy secretary determines that the security provider made a good faith effort to 
comply with these requirements but the delay was caused by circumstances outside the security 
provider’s control. All fees collected u nder this Subsection shall be deposited in the Bond Security 
and Redemption Fund as provided in R.S. 32:853(B)(2).  
C.  The secretary shall keep a record of the information received from security providers 
concerning coverage of vehicles and persons by secu rity required by R.S. 32:861, which 
information may be stored through automated electronic data processing means. After the 
department has complete vehicle liability security records, upon written request including the 
driver’s license number for each pers on, the vehicle identification number for each vehicle, and the 
payment of a fee of fifteen dollars for each vehicle owned by a person about which inquiry is 
made, the secretary shall forward to the inquiring party such vehicle and driver liability securit y 
information as is contained in the records of the department. If the department’s search of its 
records fails to show the existence of any liability insurance or other security as of the date about 
which inquiry is made, an official of the department wil l issue a sworn, notarized affidavit to that 
effect. Such an affidavit shall be prima facie evidence that on the date in question, the person or 
vehicle about which inquiry was made did not have in effect a policy of liability insurance or other 
security a s required by law. The fee collected pursuant to this Section shall be remitted by the 
secretary to the state treasurer to be credited to the Bond Security and Redemption Fund as 
provided in R.S. 32:853(B)(2).  
D.  Notwithstanding any provision of law to th e contrary, when there is a question of fact as to the 
existence of liability insurance coverage on a motor vehicle, and the owner of that motor vehicle 
has in fact maintained that coverage without lapse, and the question results from a mistake made 
by an insurance company or agent, or by any other entity, the owner of the motor vehicle shall not 
be required to pay any reinstatement fee in connection with any actions taken based on that 
question of coverage. If a reinstatement fee is imposed by the state, t he reinstatement fee shall be 
paid by the agent, company, or other entity which made the mistake.  
E.   
(1)  Prior to taking any administrative action based on the receipt of a notice of cancellation of 
insurance or other security, the secretary shall notif y the person who is the subject of the notice 
at his last known driver’s license address, of cancellation of the receipt of that notice. The 
notice of receipt of a notice of cancellation shall be in writing. The notice shall inform the 
subject that he has ten calendar days from the date of the notice in which he may surrender the 
license plates of the vehicle in order to avoid the fees prescribed by R.S. 32:863(A)(3)(a). The 
person to whom the notice is addressed shall have thirty days to respond to the not ice. The 
response may be made by mail."

§ 417.457. Damages for misappropriation — punitive damages awarded, when
1.  Except to the extent that a material and prejudicial change of position prior to acquiring 
knowledge or reason to know of misappropriation renders a monetary recovery inequitable, a 
complainant is entitled to recover damages for misappropriation. Damages can include both the 
actual loss caused by misappropriation and the unjust enrichment caused by misappropriation that 
is not taken into account in computing actual loss. In lieu of damages measured by any other 
methods, the damages caused by misappropriation may be measured by imposition of liability for 
a reasonable royalty for a misappropriator’s unauthorized disclosure or use of a trade secret.
2.  If misappropriation is outrageous because of the misappropriator’s evil motive or reckless 
indifference to the rights of others, the court may award punitive damages.

component, whichever is greater.  
(I)  When a person has the right to appear as a party in a proceeding before the 
Commission under this chapter, the person may exercise this right by filing a letter with the 
Commission stating that the person appears through the person’s duly authorized 
representative, signed by that representativ e. 
(J)  This subdivision (J) applies to an application for an electric generation facility with a 
capacity that is greater than 50 kilowatts and to an application for an energy storage facility 
that is greater than 1 megawatt, unless the facility is locate d on a new or existing structure 
the primary purpose of which is not the generation of electricity. In addition to any other 
information required by the Commission, the application for such a facility shall include 
information that delineates:  
(i)  the ful l limits of physical disturbance due to the construction and operation of the 
facility and related infrastructure, including areas disturbed due to the creation or 
modification of access roads and utility lines and the clearing or management of 
vegetation;  
(ii)  the presence and total acreage of primary agricultural soils as defined in 10 V.S.A. 
§ 6001 on each tract to be physically disturbed in connection with the construction and 
operation of the facility, the amount of those soils to be disturbed, and an y other 
proposed impacts to those soils;  
(iii)  all visible infrastructure associated with the facility; and

(6)  In any certificate of public good issued under this section for an in -state plant as defined in 
section 8002 of this title that generates electricity from wind, the Commission shall require the 
plant to install rada r-controlled obstruction lights on all wind turbines for which the Federal 
Aviation Administration (FAA) requires obstruction lights, if the plant includes four or more 
wind turbines and the FAA allows the use of radar -controlled lighting technology.  
(A)  Nothing in this subdivision shall allow the Commission to approve obstruction lights 
that do not meet FAA standards.  
(B)  The purpose of this subdivision (6) is to reduce the visual impact of wind turbine 
obstruction lights on the environment and nearby pr operties. The General Assembly finds 
that wind turbine obstruction lights that remain illuminated through the night create light 
pollution. Radar -controlled obstruction lights are only illuminated when aircraft are 
detected in the area, and therefore the u se of these lights will reduce the negative 
environmental impacts of obstruction lights."

   necessary by the governing body, in the case of a consumer -owned utility, or the commission, 
in the case of an investor -owned utility. This plan should include a process whereby near -term 
assumptions, any pilots or procurements initiated in accordance with subsection (3) of this 
section or data gathered via current market research into a similar type of utility or other 
cost/benefit studies, regularly inform and adjust the long -term projections of the plan. The goal 
of the plan should be to provide the most affordable investments for all customers and avoid 
reactive expenditures to accommodate unanticipated growth in distribu ted energy resources. 
An analysis that fairly considers wire -based and nonwires alternatives on equal terms is 
foundational to achieving this goal. The electric utility should be financially indifferent to the 
technology that is used to meet a particular r esource need. The distribution system investment 
planning process should utilize a transparent approach that involves opportunities for 
stakeholder input and feedback. The electric utility must identify in the plan the sources of 
information it relied upon , including peer -reviewed science. Any cost -benefit analysis 
conducted as part of the plan must also include at least one pessimistic scenario constructed 
from reasonable assumptions and modeling choices that would produce comparatively high 
probable costs  and comparatively low probable benefits, and at least one optimistic scenario 
constructed from reasonable assumptions and modeling choices that would produce 
comparatively low probable costs and comparatively high probable benefits;  
(f)  Include the distr ibuted energy resources identified in the plan in the electric utility’s 
integrated resource plan developed under this chapter. Distribution system plans should be 
used as inputs to the integrated resource planning process. Distributed energy resources may  be 
used to meet system needs when they are not needed to meet a local distribution need. 
Including select distributed energy resources in the integrated resource planning process allows 
those resources to displace or delay system resources in the integrat ed resource plan;  
(g)  Include a high level discussion of how the electric utility is adapting cybersecurity and 
data privacy practices to the changing distribution system and the internet of things, including 
an assessment of the costs associated with ens uring customer privacy; and  
(h)  Include a discussion of lessons learned from the planning cycle and identify process and 
data improvements planned for the next cycle.  
(3)  To ensure that procurement decisions are based on current cost and performance data  for 
distributed energy resources, a utility may procure cost -effective distributed energy resource needs 
as identified in any distributed energy resources plan through a process that is price -based and 
technology neutral. Electric utilities should conside r using competitive procurements tailored to 
meet a specific need, which may increase the utility’s ability to identify the lowest cost and most 
efficient means of meeting distribution system needs. If the projected cost of a procurement is 
more than the c alculated system net benefit of the identified distributed energy resources, the 
governing body, in the case of a consumer -owned utility, or the commission, in the case of an 
investor -owned utility, may approve a pilot process by which the electric utility  will gain a better 
understanding of the costs and benefits of a distributed energy resource or resources.  
(4)  By January 1, 2023, the legislature shall conduct an initial review of the state’s policy 
pertaining to distributed energy resources planning un der this chapter. By January 1, 2026, and 
every four years thereafter, the legislature shall conduct a full review of the policy and determine 
how many electric utilities in the state have engaged in or are engaging in a distributed energy"
