the public and private sectors.  
8.  Institutions of higher education play  a critical role in protecting and securing statewide 
cyberinfrastructure  by developing programs that support a skilled workforce, promote  
innovation  and contribute to a more secure statewide cyberinfrastructure.  
9.  It is therefore in the public interest  that the Legislature enact provisions to enable the State 
to prepare  for and mitigate risks to, and otherwise protect, information syst ems  and statewide 
cyberinfrastructure.

§ 1798.185. Regulations
Trayce Hockstadthe 12-month period in a response to a verifiable consumer request is impossible or would 
involve a disproportionate effort.
(10)Issuing regulations further defining and adding to the business purposes, including other 
notified purposes, for which businesses, service providers, and contractors may use consumers’ 
personal information consistent with consumers’ expectations, and further defining the business 
purposes for which service providers and contractors may combine consumers’ personal 
information obtained from different sources, except as provided for in paragraph (6) of 
subdivision (e) of Section 1798.140.
(11)Issuing regulations identifying those business purposes, including other notified purposes, 
for which service providers and contractors may use consumers’ personal information received 
pursuant to a written contract with a business, for the service provider or contractor’s own 
business purposes, with the goal of maximizing consumer privacy.
(12)Issuing regulations to further define “intentionally interacts,” with the goal of maximizing 
consumer privacy.
(13)Issuing regulations to further define “precise geolocation,” including if the size defined is 
not sufficient to protect consumer privacy in sparsely populated areas or when the personal 
information is used for normal operational purposes, including billing.
(14)Issuing regulations to define the term “specific pieces of information obtained from the 
consumer” with the goal of maximizing a consumer’s right to access relevant personal 
information while minimizing the delivery of information to a consumer that would not be useful 
to the consumer, including system log information and other technical data. For delivery of the 
most sensitive personal information, the regulations may require a higher standard of 
authentication provided that the agency shall monitor the impact of the higher standard on the 
right of consumers to obtain their personal information to ensure that the requirements of 
verification do not result in the unreasonable denial of verifiable consumer requests.
(15)Issuing regulations requiring businesses whose processing of consumers’ personal 
information presents significant risk to consumers’ privacy or security, to:
(A)Perform a cybersecurity audit on an annual basis, including defining the scope of the 
audit and establishing a process to ensure that audits are thorough and independent. The 
factors to be considered in determining when processing may result in significant risk to the 
security of personal information shall include the size and complexity of the business and 
the nature and scope of processing activities.
(B)Submit to the California Privacy Protection Agency on a regular basis a risk assessment 
with respect to their processing of personal information, including whether the processing 
involves sensitive personal information, and identifying and weighing the benefits resulting 
from the processing to the business, the consumer, other stakeholders, and the public, against 
the potential risks to the rights of the consumer associated with that processing, with the goal 
of restricting or prohibiting the processing if the risks to privacy of the consumer outweigh 
the benefits resulting from processing to the consumer, the business, other stakeholders, and 
the public. Nothing in this section shall require a business to divulge trade secrets.
(16)Issuing regulations governing access and opt-out rights with respect to businesses’ use of 
automated decisionmaking technology, including profiling and requiring businesses’ response to"

security program prepared by the delegate and shall receive a report from the delegate 
complying with the requirements of the report to the board of directors.
