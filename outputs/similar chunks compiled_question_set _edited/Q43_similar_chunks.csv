reasonably believed to have been acquired by an unauthorized person, and there is a reasonable 
likelihood of material harm to the consumer a s a result of the cybersecurity event. Consumer 
notification is not required for a cybersecurity event resulting from the good faith acquisition

legitimate needs of law enforcement or with any measures necessary to determine the scope of 
the breach, identify the individuals affected, and restore the reasonable integrity of the data 
system. The notification may be delayed to a date certain if th e commissioner determines that 
providing the notice impedes a criminal investigation. The licensee shall provide a copy of the 
notice to the commissioner.

shall terminate an injunction if the trade secret has ceased to exist, but the court may continue the 
injunction for an additional reasonable period of time in order to eliminate commercial advantage 
that otherwise would be derived from the misappropriation.
B.  In exceptional circumstances an injunction may condition future use on payment of a 
reasonable royalty for no longer than the period of time for which the use could have been

change of position before acquiring knowledge or reason to know of misappropriation that renders 
a prohibitive injunction inequitable.

   Vendors who have a disproportionately high number of deficient systems may 
lose their eligibility to continue to receive State -admin istered incentive funding 
through Agency programs and procurements.  
(iii)  To discourage deceptive marketing or other bad faith business practices, 
the Agency may require direct program participants, including agents operating 
on their behalf, to provide s tandardized disclosures to a customer prior to that 
customer’s execution of a contract for the development of a distributed 
generation system or a subscription to a community solar project.  
(iv)  The Agency shall establish one or multiple Consumer Complain ts Centers 
to accept complaints regarding businesses that participate in, or otherwise 
benefit from, State -administered incentive funding through Agency -
administered programs. The Agency shall maintain a public database of 
complaints with any confidential or particularly sensitive information redacted 
from public entries.  
(v)  Through a filing in the proceeding for the approval of its long -term 
renewable energy resources procurement plan, the Agency shall provide an 
annual written report to the Illinois Com merce Commission documenting the 
frequency and nature of complaints and any enforcement actions taken in 
response to those complaints.  
(vi)  The Agency shall schedule regular meetings with representatives of the 
Office of the Attorney General, the Illinois  Commerce Commission, consumer 
protection groups, and other interested stakeholders to share relevant 
information about consumer protection, project compliance, and complaints 
received.  
(vii)  To the extent that complaints received implicate the jurisdicti on of the 
Office of the Attorney General, the Illinois Commerce Commission, or local, 
State, or federal law enforcement, the Agency shall also refer complaints to 
those entities as appropriate.  
(N)  The Agency shall establish the terms, conditions, and program 
requirements for photovoltaic community renewable generation projects with a 
goal to expand access to a broader group of energy consumers, to ensure robust 
participation opportunities for residential and small commercial customers and 
those who can not install renewable energy on their own properties. Subject to 
reasonable limitations, any plan approved by the Commission shall allow 
subscriptions to community renewable generation projects to be portable and 
transferable. For purposes of this subparag raph (N), “portable” means that 
subscriptions may be retained by the subscriber even if the subscriber relocates 
or changes its address within the same utility service territory; and 
“transferable” means that a subscriber may assign or sell subscriptions t o 
another person within the same utility service territory.

   (B)  As soon as is practicable thereafter, the Agency, in consultation with the 
Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity, Department of Labor, and other

and workers in Illinois’ clean energy economy. The Agency may hire consultants and 
experts to conduct the disparity and availability study, with the reten tion of those 
consultants and experts exempt from the requirements of Section 20 -10 of the Illinois 
Procurement Code. The Illinois Power Agency shall forward a copy of its findings and 
recommendations to the Governor, the General Assembly, and the Illinois  Commerce 
Commission. If the disparity and availability study establishes a strong basis in 
evidence that there is discrimination in Illinois’ clean energy economy, the Agency, 
Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity, Department of Labor, 
Departmen t of Corrections, and other appropriate agencies shall take appropriate 
remedial actions, including race -conscious remedial actions as consistent with State 
and federal law, to effectively remedy this discrimination. Such remedies may include 
modification of the equity accountability system as described in subsection (c -10). 
(c-20)  Program data collection.

benefits of the clean energy economy provided to Illinois re sidents and businesses are 
equitably distributed across the State. The Agency shall collect data from program 
applicants in order to track and improve equitable distribution of benefits across Illinois 
communities for all procurements the Agency conducts. The Agency shall use this data to, 
among other things, measure any potential impact of racial discrimination on the 
distribution of benefits and provide information necessary to correct any discrimination 
through methods consistent with State and federal l aw. 
(2)  Agency collection of program data. The Agency shall collect demographic and 
geographic data for each entity awarded contracts under any Agency -administered 
program.

(8)  The General Assembly therefore directs the Illinois Commerce Commissio n to complete a 
transition that includes a comprehensive performance -based regulation framework for electric 
utilities serving more than 500,000 customers. The breadth of this framework should revise

(a)  Actual or threatened misappropriation may be enjoined. Upon application to the court an 
injunction shall be terminated when the trade secret has ceased to exist, but the injunction may be
