information is used for normal operational purposes, including billing.

consumer” with the goal of maximizing a consumer’s right to access relevant personal 
information while minimizing the delivery of information to a consumer that would not be useful 
to the consumer, including system log information and other technical data. For delivery of the 
most sensitive personal information, the regulations may require a higher standard of 
authentication provided that the agency shall monitor the impact of the higher standard on the

security of personal information shall include the size and complexity of the business and 
the nature and scope of processing activities.
