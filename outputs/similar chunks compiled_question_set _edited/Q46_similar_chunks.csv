B.  When a security provider does not provide the deputy secretary of public safety services of the 
Department of Public Safety and Corrections with  the information required by this Section within 
the time limits set forth in this Section, the insurance company, sales representative or agent, state 
treasurer, or other provider shall pay a late fee of not more than fifty dollars per policy, bond, or 
deposit, or other security item concerning which information is not supplied. If the security 
provider has reported this information for a policy, bond, deposit, or other security item for a 
commercial motor vehicle in an untimely manner, the deputy secretar y shall impose the late fee 
unless the deputy secretary determines that the security provider made a good faith effort to 
comply with these requirements but the delay was caused by circumstances outside the security 
provider’s control. All fees collected u nder this Subsection shall be deposited in the Bond Security 
and Redemption Fund as provided in R.S. 32:853(B)(2).  
C.  The secretary shall keep a record of the information received from security providers 
concerning coverage of vehicles and persons by secu rity required by R.S. 32:861, which 
information may be stored through automated electronic data processing means. After the 
department has complete vehicle liability security records, upon written request including the 
driver’s license number for each pers on, the vehicle identification number for each vehicle, and the 
payment of a fee of fifteen dollars for each vehicle owned by a person about which inquiry is 
made, the secretary shall forward to the inquiring party such vehicle and driver liability securit y 
information as is contained in the records of the department. If the department’s search of its 
records fails to show the existence of any liability insurance or other security as of the date about 
which inquiry is made, an official of the department wil l issue a sworn, notarized affidavit to that 
effect. Such an affidavit shall be prima facie evidence that on the date in question, the person or 
vehicle about which inquiry was made did not have in effect a policy of liability insurance or other 
security a s required by law. The fee collected pursuant to this Section shall be remitted by the 
secretary to the state treasurer to be credited to the Bond Security and Redemption Fund as 
provided in R.S. 32:853(B)(2).  
D.  Notwithstanding any provision of law to th e contrary, when there is a question of fact as to the 
existence of liability insurance coverage on a motor vehicle, and the owner of that motor vehicle 
has in fact maintained that coverage without lapse, and the question results from a mistake made 
by an insurance company or agent, or by any other entity, the owner of the motor vehicle shall not 
be required to pay any reinstatement fee in connection with any actions taken based on that 
question of coverage. If a reinstatement fee is imposed by the state, t he reinstatement fee shall be 
paid by the agent, company, or other entity which made the mistake.  
E.   
(1)  Prior to taking any administrative action based on the receipt of a notice of cancellation of 
insurance or other security, the secretary shall notif y the person who is the subject of the notice 
at his last known driver’s license address, of cancellation of the receipt of that notice. The 
notice of receipt of a notice of cancellation shall be in writing. The notice shall inform the 
subject that he has ten calendar days from the date of the notice in which he may surrender the 
license plates of the vehicle in order to avoid the fees prescribed by R.S. 32:863(A)(3)(a). The 
person to whom the notice is addressed shall have thirty days to respond to the not ice. The

(h)Notwithstanding a business’s obligations to respond to and honor consumer rights requests 
pursuant to this title:
(1)A time period for a business to respond to a consumer for any verifiable consumer request 
may be extended by up to a total of 90 days where necessary, taking into account the complexity 
and number of the requests. The business shall inform the consumer of any such extension 
within 45 days of receipt of the request, together with the reasons for the delay.
(2)If the business does not take action on the request of the consumer, the business shall 
inform the consumer, without delay and at the latest within the time period permitted of 
response by this section, of the reasons for not taking action and any rights the consumer may 
have to appeal the decision to the business.
(3)If requests from a consumer are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of 
their repetitive character, a business may either charge a reasonable fee, taking into account the 
administrative costs of providing the information or communication or taking the action 
requested, or refuse to act on the request and notify the consumer of the reason for refusing the 
request. The business shall bear the burden of demonstrating that any verifiable consumer 
request is manifestly unfounded or excessive.
(i)  
(1)A business that discloses personal information to a service provider or contractor in 
compliance with this title shall not be liable under this title if the service provider or contractor 
receiving the personal information uses it in violation of the restrictions set forth in the title, 
provided that, at the time of disclosing the personal information, the business does not have 
actual knowledge, or reason to believe, that the service provider or contractor intends to commit 
such a violation. A service provider or contractor shall likewise not be liable under this title for 
the obligations of a business for which it provides services as set forth in this title provided that 
the service provider or contractor shall be liable for its own violations of this title.
(2)A business that discloses personal information of a consumer, with the exception of 
consumers who have exercised their right to opt out of the sale or sharing of their personal 
information, consumers who have limited the use or disclosure of their sensitive personal 
information, and minor consumers who have not opted in to the collection or sale of their 
personal information, to a third party pursuant to a written contract that requires the third party to 
provide the same level of protection of the consumer’s rights under this title as provided by the 
business shall not be liable under this title if the third party receiving the personal information 
uses it in violation of the restrictions set forth in this title provided that, at the time of disclosing 
the personal information, the business does not have actual knowledge, or reason to believe, that 
the third party intends to commit such a violation.
(j)This title shall not be construed to require a business, service provider, or contractor to:
(1)Reidentify or otherwise link information that, in the ordinary course of business, is not 
maintained in a manner that would be considered personal information.
(2)Retain any personal information about a consumer if, in the ordinary course of business, 
that information about the consumer would not be retained."
