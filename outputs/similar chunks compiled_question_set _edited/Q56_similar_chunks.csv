cooperation, including  the voluntary sharing of information and analysis regarding 
cybersecurity  threats, among local, state and federa l agencies and across a broad  spectrum of 
the public and private sectors.  
8.  Institutions of higher education play  a critical role in protecting and securing statewide 
cyberinfrastructure  by developing programs that support a skilled workforce, promote  
innovation  and contribute to a more secure statewide cyberinfrastructure.  
9.  It is therefore in the public interest  that the Legislature enact provisions to enable the State 
to prepare  for and mitigate risks to, and otherwise protect, information syst ems  and statewide 
cyberinfrastructure.

   (15)  “Security breach” means an incident of unauthorized access to and acquisition of records 
or data that was not  rendered unusable through encryption, redaction, or other methods 
containing personal identifying information that compromises the security, confidentiality, or 
integrity of personal identifying information maintained by a person when illegal use of the 
information has occurred or is reasonably likely to occur or use of the information creates a 
material risk of harm to the consumer. Good faith acquisition of personal identifying 
information by an employee or agent of the person for a legitimate purpose is  not a security 
breach, if the personal identifying information is not used for a purpose other than a lawful 
purpose of the person and is not subject to further unauthorized disclosure.  
(16)  “Security freeze” means a notice placed in a consumer credit re port, at the request of the 
consumer and subject to certain exceptions, that prohibits the consumer credit -reporting
