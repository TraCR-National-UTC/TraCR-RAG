duties of licensee and board of directors; third -party service provider; incident 
response plan; certification of compliance.   
 
Sec. 555.  
(1)  Commensurate with the size and complexity of the licensee, the nature and scope of the 
licensee’s activities, including its use of third -party service providers, and the sensitivity of the 
nonpublic information used by the licensee or in the licensee’s possession, custody, or control, 
each licensee shall develop, implement, and mainta in a comprehensive written information 
security program, based on the licensee’s risk assessment, that contains administrative, technical, 
and physical safeguards for the protection of nonpublic information and the licensee’s information 
system.  
(2)  A lic ensee’s information security program must be designed to do all of the following:  
(a)  Protect the security and confidentiality of nonpublic information and the security of the 
information system.  
(b)  Protect against any threats or hazards to the security  or integrity of nonpublic information 
and the information system.  
(c)  Protect against unauthorized access to or use of nonpublic information, and minimize the 
likelihood of harm to any consumer.

   (b)  Minimiz e the disruptive effects of such  incidents on the delivery of essential services 
to the people of this  State and on the essential functions of government that ensure the  
protection of the health, safety and welfare of the people of this  State; and  
(c)  Ensure the uninterrupted and continuous  delivery of essential services to the people of 
this State and the  uninterrupted and continuous operations of the essential functions  of 
government that ensure the protection of the health, safety and  welfare of  the people of

7.  Protecting and securing the statewide  cyberinfrastructure depends on collaboration and 
cooperation, including  the voluntary sharing of information and analysis regarding 
cybersecurity  threats, among local, state and federa l agencies and across a broad  spectrum of 
the public and private sectors.  
8.  Institutions of higher education play  a critical role in protecting and securing statewide 
cyberinfrastructure  by developing programs that support a skilled workforce, promote  
innovation  and contribute to a more secure statewide cyberinfrastructure.  
9.  It is therefore in the public interest  that the Legislature enact provisions to enable the State 
to prepare  for and mitigate risks to, and otherwise protect, information syst ems  and statewide 
cyberinfrastructure.

(2)  Processors, businesses, and vendors are not liable under this section if (a) the account 
information was encrypted at the time of the breach, or  (b) the processor, business, or vendor was 
certified compliant with the payment card industry data security standards adopted by the payment 
card industry security standards council, and in force at the time of the breach. A processor, 
business, or vendor  will be considered compliant, if its payment card industry data security 
compliance was validated by an annual security assessment, and if this assessment took place no 
more than one year prior to the time of the breach. For the purposes of this subsectio n (2), a 
processor, business, or vendor’s security assessment of compliance is nonrevocable. The 
nonrevocability of a processor, business, or vendor’s security assessment of compliance is only for 
the purpose of determining a processor, business, or vendor ’s liability under this subsection (2).  
(3)   
(a)  If a processor or business fails to take reasonable care to guard against unauthorized access 
to account information that is in the possession or under the control of the business or 
processor, and the fai lure is found to be the proximate cause of a breach, the processor or 
business is liable to a financial institution for reimbursement of reasonable actual costs related 
to the reissuance of credit cards and debit cards that are incurred by the financial in stitution to 
mitigate potential current or future damages to its credit card and debit card holders that reside 
in the state of Washington as a consequence of the breach, even if the financial institution has 
not suffered a physical injury in connection wi th the breach. In any legal action brought 
pursuant to this subsection, the prevailing party is entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys’ 
fees and costs incurred in connection with the legal action.  
(b)  A vendor, instead of a processor or business, is  liable to a financial institution for the 
damages described in (a) of this subsection to the extent that the damages were proximately 
caused by the vendor’s negligence and if the claim is not limited or foreclosed by another 
provision of law or by a contr act to which the financial institution is a party.  
(4)  Nothing in this section may be construed as preventing or foreclosing any entity responsible 
for handling account information on behalf of a business or processor from being made a party to 
an action under this section.  
(5)  Nothing in this section may be construed as preventing or foreclosing a processor, business, or 
vendor from asserting any defense otherwise available to it in an action including, but not limited 
to, defenses of contract, or of con tributory or comparative negligence.  
(6)  In cases to which this section applies, the trier of fact shall determine the percentage of the 
total fault which is attributable to every entity which was the proximate cause of the claimant’s 
damages.  
(7)  The re medies under this section are cumulative and do not restrict any other right or remedy 
otherwise available under law, however a trier of fact may reduce damages awarded to a financial 
institution by any amount the financial institution recovers from a cred it card company in
