progra m annually, certify to the office of cybersecurity that its program is in compliance with 
the office of cybersecurity’s security standards and policies, and provide the office of 
cybersecurity with a list of the agency’s cybersecurity business needs and ag ency program 
metrics.

compliance audit of its information technology security program and controls at least once 
every three y ears to determine whether the state agency’s information technology security 
program is in compliance with the standards and policies established by the agency and that 
security controls identified by the state agency in its security program are operating efficiently.                       
                     
(c)  If a review or an audit conducted under (a) or (b) of this subsection identifies any failure to 
comply with the standards and policies of the office of cybersecurity or any other material 
cyberse curity risk, the office of cybersecurity must require the state agency to formulate and 
implement a plan to resolve the failure or risk. On an annual basis, the office of cybersecurity 
must provide a confidential report to the governor and appropriate comm ittees of the 
legislature identifying and describing the cybersecurity risk or failure to comply with the office 
of cybersecurity’s security policy or implementing cybersecurity standards and policies, as 
well as the agency’s plan to resolve such failure o r risk. Risks that are not mitigated are to be 
tracked by the office of cybersecurity and reviewed with the governor and the chair and 
ranking member of the appropriate committees of the legislature on a quarterly basis.

(8)  In the case of institutions of higher education, t he judiciary, and the legislature, each 
information technology security program must be comparable to the intended outcomes of the 
office of cybersecurity’s security standards and policies.
