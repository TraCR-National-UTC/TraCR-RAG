pursuant to this title:
(1)A time period for a business to respond to a consumer for any verifiable consumer request 
may be extended by up to a total of 90 days where necessary, taking into account the complexity

inform the consumer, without delay and at the latest within the time period permitted of 
response by this section, of the reasons for not taking action and any rights the consumer may 
have to appeal the decision to the business.
(3)If requests from a consumer are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of 
their repetitive character, a business may either charge a reasonable fee, taking into account the 
administrative costs of providing the information or communication or taking the action 
requested, or refuse to act on the request and notify the consumer of the reason for refusing the 
request. The business shall bear the burden of demonstrating that any verifiable consumer 
request is manifestly unfounded or excessive.

such a violation. A service provider or contractor shall likewise not be liable under this title for 
the obligations of a business for which it provides services as set forth in this title provided that 
the service provider or contractor shall be liable for its own violations of this title.
(2)A business that discloses personal information of a consumer, with the exception of 
consumers who have exercised their right to opt out of the sale or sharing of their personal 
information, consumers who have limited the use or disclosure of their sensitive personal

personal information, to a third party pursuant to a written contract that requires the third party to 
provide the same level of protection of the consumer’s rights under this title as provided by the

uses it in violation of the restrictions set forth in this title provided that, at the time of disclosing 
the personal information, the business does not have actual knowledge, or reason to believe, that 
the third party intends to commit such a violation.
(j)This title shall not be construed to require a business, service provider, or contractor to:
(1)Reidentify or otherwise link information that, in the ordinary course of business, is not 
maintained in a manner that would be considered personal information.
