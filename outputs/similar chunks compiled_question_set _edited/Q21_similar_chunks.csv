comply with the standards and policies of the office of cybersecurity or any other material 
cyberse curity risk, the office of cybersecurity must require the state agency to formulate and 
implement a plan to resolve the failure or risk. On an annual basis, the office of cybersecurity 
must provide a confidential report to the governor and appropriate comm ittees of the 
legislature identifying and describing the cybersecurity risk or failure to comply with the office 
of cybersecurity’s security policy or implementing cybersecurity standards and policies, as 
well as the agency’s plan to resolve such failure o r risk. Risks that are not mitigated are to be 
tracked by the office of cybersecurity and reviewed with the governor and the chair and
