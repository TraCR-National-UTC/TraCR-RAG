 Trayce Hockstad   (2)  If the person to whom the notice is addressed is able to show that the insurance or other 
security was canceled for a legitimate reason, the secretary shall take no administrative action 
against that person. Legi timate reasons for cancellation of insurance or other security shall 
include but shall not be limited to the transfer of ownership of the vehicle or the surrender of 
the license plate of the formerly insured vehicle. If the vehicle is sold within ten calen dar days 
after the date liability security on the vehicle was cancelled or its license plate is surrendered 
within ten calendar days of the date of notice sent pursuant to Paragraph (1) of this Subsection, 
no administrative action shall be taken. The trans fer of ownership of the vehicle may be 
established by presenting to the secretary a copy of the title transfer or a copy of the act of sale, 
donation, exchange, surrender to a salvage yard, or other transaction.  
(3)  If the original of the document present ed as proof of transfer of ownership has not been 
notarized, the authenticity of the document may be established by an affidavit executed by the 
person to whom the notice is addressed in which that person recites the circumstances of the 
transfer of owners hip of the vehicle and attests to the truthfulness and accuracy of the 
document presented as proof of transfer of ownership.  
F.   
(1)  The secretary shall formulate criteria to develop and initiate a request for proposals to 
procure and implement a real -time system to quickly and accurately identify and verify the 
existence of motor vehicle insurance or other security required in compliance with the Motor 
Vehicle Safety Responsibility Law using advanced telecommunications and computer 
technology.  
(2)  The c riteria established by the secretary shall be developed only after consulting with an 
advisory group consisting of the commissioner of insurance or his designee, the superintendent 
of state police or his designee, the executive director of the Louisiana Hi ghway Safety 
Commission or his designee, and five additional members, one representing the American 
Insurance Association, one representing the Property Casualty Insurance Association of 
America, one selected from a list of names submitted by the three ins urers with the largest 
market share of automobile insurance in Louisiana, one from the Louisiana Association of Fire 
and Casualty Companies, and one from the Louisiana Independent Agents Association.  
(3)  The request for proposal shall require participants  to develop a system that allows real -
time access to state and local law enforcement officials allowing them to obtain the status of 
the existence of motor vehicle insurance or other security required in this state as provided in 
the Motor Vehicle Safety R esponsibility Law.  
(4)  The system developed pursuant to this Subsection may initially be implemented by the 
secretary as a six -month pilot program to be developed and implemented statewide upon 
expiration of the six -month period.  
(5)  The secretary shall require such information as may be necessary from automobile insurers 
or their representatives and the state treasurer as is needed to assist the contractor in 
developing the system as such relates to the cancellation or issuance of motor vehicle liability  
security or deposit of sufficient security with the state treasurer in order to operate a motor 
vehicle in this state.  
(6)  The secretary shall promulgate rules and regulations to implement the provisions of this 
Subsection."

maintain the security required by law.  
B.  When a security provider does not provide the deputy secretary of public safety services of the 
Department of Public Safety and Corrections with  the information required by this Section within 
the time limits set forth in this Section, the insurance company, sales representative or agent, state 
treasurer, or other provider shall pay a late fee of not more than fifty dollars per policy, bond, or 
deposit, or other security item concerning which information is not supplied. If the security 
provider has reported this information for a policy, bond, deposit, or other security item for a 
commercial motor vehicle in an untimely manner, the deputy secretar y shall impose the late fee 
unless the deputy secretary determines that the security provider made a good faith effort to 
comply with these requirements but the delay was caused by circumstances outside the security 
provider’s control. All fees collected u nder this Subsection shall be deposited in the Bond Security 
and Redemption Fund as provided in R.S. 32:853(B)(2).  
C.  The secretary shall keep a record of the information received from security providers 
concerning coverage of vehicles and persons by secu rity required by R.S. 32:861, which 
information may be stored through automated electronic data processing means. After the 
department has complete vehicle liability security records, upon written request including the 
driver’s license number for each pers on, the vehicle identification number for each vehicle, and the 
payment of a fee of fifteen dollars for each vehicle owned by a person about which inquiry is 
made, the secretary shall forward to the inquiring party such vehicle and driver liability securit y 
information as is contained in the records of the department. If the department’s search of its 
records fails to show the existence of any liability insurance or other security as of the date about 
which inquiry is made, an official of the department wil l issue a sworn, notarized affidavit to that 
effect. Such an affidavit shall be prima facie evidence that on the date in question, the person or 
vehicle about which inquiry was made did not have in effect a policy of liability insurance or other 
security a s required by law. The fee collected pursuant to this Section shall be remitted by the 
secretary to the state treasurer to be credited to the Bond Security and Redemption Fund as 
provided in R.S. 32:853(B)(2).  
D.  Notwithstanding any provision of law to th e contrary, when there is a question of fact as to the 
existence of liability insurance coverage on a motor vehicle, and the owner of that motor vehicle 
has in fact maintained that coverage without lapse, and the question results from a mistake made 
by an insurance company or agent, or by any other entity, the owner of the motor vehicle shall not 
be required to pay any reinstatement fee in connection with any actions taken based on that 
question of coverage. If a reinstatement fee is imposed by the state, t he reinstatement fee shall be 
paid by the agent, company, or other entity which made the mistake.  
E.   
(1)  Prior to taking any administrative action based on the receipt of a notice of cancellation of 
insurance or other security, the secretary shall notif y the person who is the subject of the notice 
at his last known driver’s license address, of cancellation of the receipt of that notice. The 
notice of receipt of a notice of cancellation shall be in writing. The notice shall inform the 
subject that he has ten calendar days from the date of the notice in which he may surrender the 
license plates of the vehicle in order to avoid the fees prescribed by R.S. 32:863(A)(3)(a). The 
person to whom the notice is addressed shall have thirty days to respond to the not ice. The 
response may be made by mail."

1.  An individual who has learned or reasonably suspects that the individual’s personal identifying 
information has been unlawfully used by another, as described in section 12.1 -23-11, may initiate 
a law enforcement investigation by contacting the local law en forcement agency that has 
jurisdiction over the individual’s residence or any other jurisdiction in which any part of the 
offense occurred. The law enforcement agency shall take a report of the matter, provide the 
individual with a copy of that report, and  begin an investigation of the facts. If the suspected crime 
was committed in a different jurisdiction, the local law enforcement agency may refer the matter to 
the law enforcement agency where the suspected crime was committed for further investigation of  
the facts.  
2.  An individual who reasonably believes that the individual is the victim of identity theft may 
petition the district court in the county in which the alleged victim resides or in which the identity 
theft is alleged to have occurred, or the c ourt, on its own motion or upon application of the state’s 
attorney, may move for an expedited judicial determination of the individual’s factual innocence, 
if the perpetrator of the identity theft was arrested, cited, or convicted of a crime under the vic tim’s 
identity, if a criminal complaint has been filed against the perpetrator in the victim’s name, or if 
the victim’s identity has been mistakenly associated with a record of criminal conviction. Any 
judicial determination of factual innocence made under  this section may be heard and determined 
upon declarations, affidavits, police reports, or other material, relevant, and reliable information 
submitted by the parties or ordered to be part of the record by the court. If the court determines 
that the petit ion or motion is meritorious and that there is no reasonable cause to believe that the 
victim committed the offense for which the perpetrator of the identity theft was arrested, cited, 
convicted, or subject to a criminal complaint in the victim’s name, or that the victim’s identity has 
been mistakenly associated with a record of criminal conviction, the court shall find the victim 
factually innocent of that offense. If the victim is found factually innocent, the court shall issue an 
order certifying that de termination.
