harm to the individuals whose personal in formation has been breached.

does not own or license shall give notice to and cooperate with the owner or licensee of the

notice will not compromise the criminal inve stigation and so notifies the person of such 
determination.

includes personal information shall disclose any breach of the security of the system to any 
resident of this state whose personal information was, or is reasonably believed to have been,

that the person or business does not own or license shall notify the owner or licensee of the 
information of any breach of the security of the data immediately following discovery, if the 
personal information was, or is reasonably believ ed to have been, acquired by an unauthorized 
person.

(10)Issuing regulations further defining and adding to the business purposes, including other 
notified purposes, for which businesses, service providers, and contractors may use consumers’ 
personal information consistent with consumers’ expectations, and further defining the business 
purposes for which service providers and contractors may combine consumers’ personal 
information obtained from different sources, except as provided for in paragraph (6) of 
subdivision (e) of Section 1798.140.
(11)Issuing regulations identifying those business purposes, including other notified purposes, 
for which service providers and contractors may use consumers’ personal information received

business purposes, with the goal of maximizing consumer privacy.

(13)Issuing regulations to further define “precise geolocation,” including if the size defined is 
not sufficient to protect consumer privacy in sparsely populated areas or when the personal 
information is used for normal operational purposes, including billing.
(14)Issuing regulations to define the term “specific pieces of information obtained from the 
consumer” with the goal of maximizing a consumer’s right to access relevant personal 
information while minimizing the delivery of information to a consumer that would not be useful 
to the consumer, including system log information and other technical data. For delivery of the 
most sensitive personal information, the regulations may require a higher standard of 
authentication provided that the agency shall monitor the impact of the higher standard on the 
right of consumers to obtain their personal information to ensure that the requirements of 
verification do not result in the unreasonable denial of verifiable consumer requests.
(15)Issuing regulations requiring businesses whose processing of consumers’ personal 
information presents significant risk to consumers’ privacy or security, to:
(A)Perform a cybersecurity audit on an annual basis, including defining the scope of the 
audit and establishing a process to ensure that audits are thorough and independent. The 
factors to be considered in determining when processing may result in significant risk to the 
security of personal information shall include the size and complexity of the business and 
the nature and scope of processing activities.
(B)Submit to the California Privacy Protection Agency on a regular basis a risk assessment 
with respect to their processing of personal information, including whether the processing 
involves sensitive personal information, and identifying and weighing the benefits resulting 
from the processing to the business, the consumer, other stakeholders, and the public, against 
the potential risks to the rights of the consumer associated with that processing, with the goal 
of restricting or prohibiting the processing if the risks to privacy of the consumer outweigh 
the benefits resulting from processing to the consumer, the business, other stakeholders, and 
the public. Nothing in this section shall require a business to divulge trade secrets.

inform the consumer, without delay and at the latest within the time period permitted of 
response by this section, of the reasons for not taking action and any rights the consumer may 
have to appeal the decision to the business.
(3)If requests from a consumer are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of 
their repetitive character, a business may either charge a reasonable fee, taking into account the 
administrative costs of providing the information or communication or taking the action 
requested, or refuse to act on the request and notify the consumer of the reason for refusing the 
request. The business shall bear the burden of demonstrating that any verifiable consumer 
request is manifestly unfounded or excessive.

receiving the personal information uses it in violation of the restrictions set forth in the title, 
provided that, at the time of disclosing the personal information, the business does not have 
actual knowledge, or reason to believe, that the service provider or contractor intends to commit 
such a violation. A service provider or contractor shall likewise not be liable under this title for 
the obligations of a business for which it provides services as set forth in this title provided that 
the service provider or contractor shall be liable for its own violations of this title.
(2)A business that discloses personal information of a consumer, with the exception of 
consumers who have exercised their right to opt out of the sale or sharing of their personal 
information, consumers who have limited the use or disclosure of their sensitive personal 
information, and minor consumers who have not opted in to the collection or sale of their 
personal information, to a third party pursuant to a written contract that requires the third party to

exceed $250,000 or that the affected class of subject persons to be notified exceeds 500,000, or 
the data collector does not have suff icient contact information. Substitute notice shall consist 
of all of the following: (i) email notice if the data collector has an email address for the subject 
persons; (ii) conspicuous posting of the notice on the data collector’s web site page if the da ta 
collector maintains one; and (iii) notification to major statewide media or, if the breach 
impacts residents in one geographic area, to prominent local media in areas where affected 
individuals are likely to reside if such notice is reasonably calculate d to give actual notice to 
persons whom notice is required.  
(d)  Notwithstanding any other subsection in this Section, a data collector that maintains its own 
notification procedures as part of an information security policy for the treatment of personal 
information and is otherwise consistent with the timing requirements of this Act, shall be deemed

subject persons in accordance with its policies in the event of  a breach of the security of the system 
data.  
(e)

Illinois residents as a result of a single breach of the security system shall provide notice to the 
Attorney General of the breach, including:
