(2)  Processors, businesses, and vendors are not liable under this section if (a) the account 
information was encrypted at the time of the breach, or  (b) the processor, business, or vendor was 
certified compliant with the payment card industry data security standards adopted by the payment 
card industry security standards council, and in force at the time of the breach. A processor, 
business, or vendor  will be considered compliant, if its payment card industry data security 
compliance was validated by an annual security assessment, and if this assessment took place no 
more than one year prior to the time of the breach. For the purposes of this subsectio n (2), a 
processor, business, or vendor’s security assessment of compliance is nonrevocable. The 
nonrevocability of a processor, business, or vendor’s security assessment of compliance is only for 
the purpose of determining a processor, business, or vendor ’s liability under this subsection (2).  
(3)   
(a)  If a processor or business fails to take reasonable care to guard against unauthorized access 
to account information that is in the possession or under the control of the business or 
processor, and the fai lure is found to be the proximate cause of a breach, the processor or 
business is liable to a financial institution for reimbursement of reasonable actual costs related 
to the reissuance of credit cards and debit cards that are incurred by the financial in stitution to 
mitigate potential current or future damages to its credit card and debit card holders that reside 
in the state of Washington as a consequence of the breach, even if the financial institution has 
not suffered a physical injury in connection wi th the breach. In any legal action brought 
pursuant to this subsection, the prevailing party is entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys’ 
fees and costs incurred in connection with the legal action.  
(b)  A vendor, instead of a processor or business, is  liable to a financial institution for the 
damages described in (a) of this subsection to the extent that the damages were proximately 
caused by the vendor’s negligence and if the claim is not limited or foreclosed by another 
provision of law or by a contr act to which the financial institution is a party.  
(4)  Nothing in this section may be construed as preventing or foreclosing any entity responsible 
for handling account information on behalf of a business or processor from being made a party to 
an action under this section.  
(5)  Nothing in this section may be construed as preventing or foreclosing a processor, business, or 
vendor from asserting any defense otherwise available to it in an action including, but not limited 
to, defenses of contract, or of con tributory or comparative negligence.  
(6)  In cases to which this section applies, the trier of fact shall determine the percentage of the 
total fault which is attributable to every entity which was the proximate cause of the claimant’s 
damages.

§ 1798.150. Personal Information Security Breaches
(a)  
(1)Any consumer whose nonencrypted and nonredacted personal information, as defined in 
subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1) of subdivision (d) of Section 1798.81.5, or whose email 
address in combination with a password or security question and answer that would permit 
access to the account is subject to an unauthorized access and exfiltration, theft, or disclosure 
as a result of the business’s violation of the duty to implement and maintain reasonable security 
procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information to protect the personal 
information may institute a civil action for any of the following:
(A)To recover damages in an amount not less than one hundred dollars ($100) and not 
greater than seven hundred and fifty ($750) per consumer per incident or actual damages, 
whichever is greater.
(B)Injunctive or declaratory relief.
(C)Any other relief the court deems proper.
(2)In assessing the amount of statutory damages, the court shall consider any one or more of the 
relevant circumstances presented by any of the parties to the case, including, but not limited to, 
the nature and seriousness of the misconduct, the number of violations, the persistence of the 
misconduct, the length of time over which the misconduct occurred, the willfulness of the 
defendant’s misconduct, and the defendant’s assets, liabilities, and net worth.
(b)Actions pursuant to this section may be brought by a consumer if, prior to initiating any action 
against a business for statutory damages on an individual or class-wide basis, a consumer provides a 
business 30 days’ written notice identifying the specific provisions of this title the consumer alleges 
have been or are being violated. In the event a cure is possible, if within the 30 days the business 
actually cures the noticed violation and provides the consumer an express written statement that the 
violations have been cured and that no further violations shall occur, no action for individual 
statutory damages or class-wide statutory damages may be initiated against the business. The 
implementation and maintenance of reasonable security procedures and practices pursuant to Section 
1798.81.5 following a breach does not constitute a cure with respect to that breach.  No notice shall 
be required prior to an individual consumer initiating an action solely for actual pecuniary damages"

(h)Notwithstanding a business’s obligations to respond to and honor consumer rights requests 
pursuant to this title:
(1)A time period for a business to respond to a consumer for any verifiable consumer request 
may be extended by up to a total of 90 days where necessary, taking into account the complexity 
and number of the requests. The business shall inform the consumer of any such extension 
within 45 days of receipt of the request, together with the reasons for the delay.
(2)If the business does not take action on the request of the consumer, the business shall 
inform the consumer, without delay and at the latest within the time period permitted of 
response by this section, of the reasons for not taking action and any rights the consumer may 
have to appeal the decision to the business.
(3)If requests from a consumer are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of 
their repetitive character, a business may either charge a reasonable fee, taking into account the 
administrative costs of providing the information or communication or taking the action 
requested, or refuse to act on the request and notify the consumer of the reason for refusing the 
request. The business shall bear the burden of demonstrating that any verifiable consumer 
request is manifestly unfounded or excessive.

personal information, to a third party pursuant to a written contract that requires the third party to 
provide the same level of protection of the consumer’s rights under this title as provided by the 
business shall not be liable under this title if the third party receiving the personal information 
uses it in violation of the restrictions set forth in this title provided that, at the time of disclosing 
the personal information, the business does not have actual knowledge, or reason to believe, that 
the third party intends to commit such a violation.
(j)This title shall not be construed to require a business, service provider, or contractor to:
(1)Reidentify or otherwise link information that, in the ordinary course of business, is not 
maintained in a manner that would be considered personal information.
(2)Retain any personal information about a consumer if, in the ordinary course of business, 
that information about the consumer would not be retained."
