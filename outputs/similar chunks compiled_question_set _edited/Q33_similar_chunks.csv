burning, arcing/sparking, or the restriction of ingress and egress from a building or vehicle, 
or other immediate hazards. Such plans shall, at minimum, include proc edures to identify,

investigatory proceedings, the commission finds that the corporation failed to reasonably 
implement its emergency response plan or the length of such corporation’s outages were 
materially longer than they would have been, because of such corporation’s  failure to 
reasonably implement its emergency response plan, the commission may deny the recovery 
of any part of the service restoration costs caused by such failure, commensurate with the"
