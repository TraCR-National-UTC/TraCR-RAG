is not taken into account in computing actual loss. In lieu of damages measured by any other 
methods, the damages caused by misappropriation may be measured by imposition of liability for 
a reasonable royalty for a misappropriator’s unauthorized disclosure or use of a trade secret.  
(2)  If willful and malicious misappropriation exists, the court may award exemplary damages in 
an amount not exceeding twice any award made under subsection (1) of this section.

injunction shall be terminated when the trade secret has ceased to exist, but the injunction may be 
continued for an additional reasonable period of time in order to eliminate commercial advantage 
that otherwise would be derived from the misappropriation.
2.  In exceptional circumstances, an injunction may condition future use upon payment of a

fees and costs incurred in connection with the legal action.  
(b)  A vendor, instead of a processor or business, is  liable to a financial institution for the 
damages described in (a) of this subsection to the extent that the damages were proximately 
caused by the vendor’s negligence and if the claim is not limited or foreclosed by another 
provision of law or by a contr act to which the financial institution is a party.  
(4)  Nothing in this section may be construed as preventing or foreclosing any entity responsible 
for handling account information on behalf of a business or processor from being made a party to 
an action under this section.  
(5)  Nothing in this section may be construed as preventing or foreclosing a processor, business, or 
vendor from asserting any defense otherwise available to it in an action including, but not limited 
to, defenses of contract, or of con tributory or comparative negligence.  
(6)  In cases to which this section applies, the trier of fact shall determine the percentage of the 
total fault which is attributable to every entity which was the proximate cause of the claimant’s 
damages.  
(7)  The re medies under this section are cumulative and do not restrict any other right or remedy 
otherwise available under law, however a trier of fact may reduce damages awarded to a financial 
institution by any amount the financial institution recovers from a cred it card company in 
connection with the breach, for costs associated with access card reissuance.

(h)Notwithstanding a business’s obligations to respond to and honor consumer rights requests 
pursuant to this title:
(1)A time period for a business to respond to a consumer for any verifiable consumer request 
may be extended by up to a total of 90 days where necessary, taking into account the complexity 
and number of the requests. The business shall inform the consumer of any such extension 
within 45 days of receipt of the request, together with the reasons for the delay.
(2)If the business does not take action on the request of the consumer, the business shall 
inform the consumer, without delay and at the latest within the time period permitted of 
response by this section, of the reasons for not taking action and any rights the consumer may 
have to appeal the decision to the business.
(3)If requests from a consumer are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of 
their repetitive character, a business may either charge a reasonable fee, taking into account the 
administrative costs of providing the information or communication or taking the action 
requested, or refuse to act on the request and notify the consumer of the reason for refusing the 
request. The business shall bear the burden of demonstrating that any verifiable consumer 
request is manifestly unfounded or excessive.
(i)  
(1)A business that discloses personal information to a service provider or contractor in 
compliance with this title shall not be liable under this title if the service provider or contractor 
receiving the personal information uses it in violation of the restrictions set forth in the title, 
provided that, at the time of disclosing the personal information, the business does not have 
actual knowledge, or reason to believe, that the service provider or contractor intends to commit 
such a violation. A service provider or contractor shall likewise not be liable under this title for 
the obligations of a business for which it provides services as set forth in this title provided that 
the service provider or contractor shall be liable for its own violations of this title.
(2)A business that discloses personal information of a consumer, with the exception of 
consumers who have exercised their right to opt out of the sale or sharing of their personal 
information, consumers who have limited the use or disclosure of their sensitive personal 
information, and minor consumers who have not opted in to the collection or sale of their 
personal information, to a third party pursuant to a written contract that requires the third party to 
provide the same level of protection of the consumer’s rights under this title as provided by the 
business shall not be liable under this title if the third party receiving the personal information 
uses it in violation of the restrictions set forth in this title provided that, at the time of disclosing 
the personal information, the business does not have actual knowledge, or reason to believe, that 
the third party intends to commit such a violation.
(j)This title shall not be construed to require a business, service provider, or contractor to:
(1)Reidentify or otherwise link information that, in the ordinary course of business, is not 
maintained in a manner that would be considered personal information.
(2)Retain any personal information about a consumer if, in the ordinary course of business, 
that information about the consumer would not be retained."

§ 1798.150. Personal Information Security Breaches
(a)  
(1)Any consumer whose nonencrypted and nonredacted personal information, as defined in 
subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1) of subdivision (d) of Section 1798.81.5, or whose email 
address in combination with a password or security question and answer that would permit 
access to the account is subject to an unauthorized access and exfiltration, theft, or disclosure 
as a result of the business’s violation of the duty to implement and maintain reasonable security 
procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information to protect the personal 
information may institute a civil action for any of the following:
(A)To recover damages in an amount not less than one hundred dollars ($100) and not 
greater than seven hundred and fifty ($750) per consumer per incident or actual damages, 
whichever is greater.
(B)Injunctive or declaratory relief.
(C)Any other relief the court deems proper.
(2)In assessing the amount of statutory damages, the court shall consider any one or more of the 
relevant circumstances presented by any of the parties to the case, including, but not limited to, 
the nature and seriousness of the misconduct, the number of violations, the persistence of the 
misconduct, the length of time over which the misconduct occurred, the willfulness of the 
defendant’s misconduct, and the defendant’s assets, liabilities, and net worth.
(b)Actions pursuant to this section may be brought by a consumer if, prior to initiating any action 
against a business for statutory damages on an individual or class-wide basis, a consumer provides a 
business 30 days’ written notice identifying the specific provisions of this title the consumer alleges 
have been or are being violated. In the event a cure is possible, if within the 30 days the business 
actually cures the noticed violation and provides the consumer an express written statement that the 
violations have been cured and that no further violations shall occur, no action for individual 
statutory damages or class-wide statutory damages may be initiated against the business. The 
implementation and maintenance of reasonable security procedures and practices pursuant to Section 
1798.81.5 following a breach does not constitute a cure with respect to that breach.  No notice shall

information and is under no legal requirement to seek out other persons that may have or claim to 
have rights to personal information, and a business is under no legal obligation under this title or any 
other provision of law to take any action under this title in the event of a dispute between or among 
persons claiming rights to personal information in the business’s possession.
