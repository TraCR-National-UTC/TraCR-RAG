after the date liability security on the vehicle was cancelled or its license plate is surrendered 
within ten calendar days of the date of notice sent pursuant to Paragraph (1) of this Subsection, 
no administrative action shall be taken. The trans fer of ownership of the vehicle may be 
established by presenting to the secretary a copy of the title transfer or a copy of the act of sale, 
donation, exchange, surrender to a salvage yard, or other transaction.  
(3)  If the original of the document present ed as proof of transfer of ownership has not been 
notarized, the authenticity of the document may be established by an affidavit executed by the 
person to whom the notice is addressed in which that person recites the circumstances of the 
transfer of owners hip of the vehicle and attests to the truthfulness and accuracy of the 
document presented as proof of transfer of ownership.

procure and implement a real -time system to quickly and accurately identify and verify the 
existence of motor vehicle insurance or other security required in compliance with the Motor 
Vehicle Safety Responsibility Law using advanced telecommunications and computer 
technology.  
(2)  The c riteria established by the secretary shall be developed only after consulting with an 
advisory group consisting of the commissioner of insurance or his designee, the superintendent 
of state police or his designee, the executive director of the Louisiana Hi ghway Safety 
Commission or his designee, and five additional members, one representing the American 
Insurance Association, one representing the Property Casualty Insurance Association of 
America, one selected from a list of names submitted by the three ins urers with the largest 
market share of automobile insurance in Louisiana, one from the Louisiana Association of Fire 
and Casualty Companies, and one from the Louisiana Independent Agents Association.

time access to state and local law enforcement officials allowing them to obtain the status of 
the existence of motor vehicle insurance or other security required in this state as provided in 
the Motor Vehicle Safety R esponsibility Law.  
(4)  The system developed pursuant to this Subsection may initially be implemented by the 
secretary as a six -month pilot program to be developed and implemented statewide upon 
expiration of the six -month period.  
(5)  The secretary shall require such information as may be necessary from automobile insurers 
or their representatives and the state treasurer as is needed to assist the contractor in

maintain the security required by law.  
B.  When a security provider does not provide the deputy secretary of public safety services of the 
Department of Public Safety and Corrections with  the information required by this Section within 
the time limits set forth in this Section, the insurance company, sales representative or agent, state 
treasurer, or other provider shall pay a late fee of not more than fifty dollars per policy, bond, or 
deposit, or other security item concerning which information is not supplied. If the security 
provider has reported this information for a policy, bond, deposit, or other security item for a 
commercial motor vehicle in an untimely manner, the deputy secretar y shall impose the late fee 
unless the deputy secretary determines that the security provider made a good faith effort to 
comply with these requirements but the delay was caused by circumstances outside the security 
provider’s control. All fees collected u nder this Subsection shall be deposited in the Bond Security 
and Redemption Fund as provided in R.S. 32:853(B)(2).  
C.  The secretary shall keep a record of the information received from security providers 
concerning coverage of vehicles and persons by secu rity required by R.S. 32:861, which 
information may be stored through automated electronic data processing means. After the 
department has complete vehicle liability security records, upon written request including the 
driver’s license number for each pers on, the vehicle identification number for each vehicle, and the 
payment of a fee of fifteen dollars for each vehicle owned by a person about which inquiry is 
made, the secretary shall forward to the inquiring party such vehicle and driver liability securit y 
information as is contained in the records of the department. If the department’s search of its 
records fails to show the existence of any liability insurance or other security as of the date about 
which inquiry is made, an official of the department wil l issue a sworn, notarized affidavit to that 
effect. Such an affidavit shall be prima facie evidence that on the date in question, the person or 
vehicle about which inquiry was made did not have in effect a policy of liability insurance or other 
security a s required by law. The fee collected pursuant to this Section shall be remitted by the 
secretary to the state treasurer to be credited to the Bond Security and Redemption Fund as 
provided in R.S. 32:853(B)(2).  
D.  Notwithstanding any provision of law to th e contrary, when there is a question of fact as to the 
existence of liability insurance coverage on a motor vehicle, and the owner of that motor vehicle 
has in fact maintained that coverage without lapse, and the question results from a mistake made 
by an insurance company or agent, or by any other entity, the owner of the motor vehicle shall not 
be required to pay any reinstatement fee in connection with any actions taken based on that 
question of coverage. If a reinstatement fee is imposed by the state, t he reinstatement fee shall be 
paid by the agent, company, or other entity which made the mistake.  
E.   
(1)  Prior to taking any administrative action based on the receipt of a notice of cancellation of 
insurance or other security, the secretary shall notif y the person who is the subject of the notice 
at his last known driver’s license address, of cancellation of the receipt of that notice. The 
notice of receipt of a notice of cancellation shall be in writing. The notice shall inform the 
subject that he has ten calendar days from the date of the notice in which he may surrender the 
license plates of the vehicle in order to avoid the fees prescribed by R.S. 32:863(A)(3)(a). The 
person to whom the notice is addressed shall have thirty days to respond to the not ice. The 
response may be made by mail."

determines that the type of personal information described in subsection (1)(g)(I)(B) of this 
section has been misused or is re asonably likely to be misused, then the covered entity shall, in 
addition to the notice otherwise required by subsection (2)(a.2) of this section and in the most 
expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, but not later than thirty days after t he

same username or e -mail address and password or security question or answer.  
(II)  For log -in credentials of an e -mail account furnished by the covere d entity, the 
covered entity shall not comply with this section by providing the security breach

the residents and the approximate number of residents who are to be notified. Nothing in this 
subsection (2)(d) requires the covered entity to provide to the consumer reporting agency the 
names or other personal information of security breach notice recipients. This subsection (2)(d) 
does not apply to a covered entity who is subject to Title V of the federal “Gramm -Leach -
Bliley Act”, 15 U.S.C. sec. 6801 et seq.  
(e)  A waiver of these notification rights or responsibilities i s void as against public policy.  
(f)   
(I)  The covered entity that must notify Colorado residents of a data breach pursuant to this 
section shall provide notice of any security breach  to the Colorado attorney general in the 
most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, but not later than thirty days

(2)  Processors, businesses, and vendors are not liable under this section if (a) the account 
information was encrypted at the time of the breach, or  (b) the processor, business, or vendor was 
certified compliant with the payment card industry data security standards adopted by the payment 
card industry security standards council, and in force at the time of the breach. A processor, 
business, or vendor  will be considered compliant, if its payment card industry data security 
compliance was validated by an annual security assessment, and if this assessment took place no 
more than one year prior to the time of the breach. For the purposes of this subsectio n (2), a 
processor, business, or vendor’s security assessment of compliance is nonrevocable. The 
nonrevocability of a processor, business, or vendor’s security assessment of compliance is only for 
the purpose of determining a processor, business, or vendor ’s liability under this subsection (2).  
(3)   
(a)  If a processor or business fails to take reasonable care to guard against unauthorized access 
to account information that is in the possession or under the control of the business or 
processor, and the fai lure is found to be the proximate cause of a breach, the processor or 
business is liable to a financial institution for reimbursement of reasonable actual costs related 
to the reissuance of credit cards and debit cards that are incurred by the financial in stitution to 
mitigate potential current or future damages to its credit card and debit card holders that reside 
in the state of Washington as a consequence of the breach, even if the financial institution has 
not suffered a physical injury in connection wi th the breach. In any legal action brought 
pursuant to this subsection, the prevailing party is entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys’ 
fees and costs incurred in connection with the legal action.  
(b)  A vendor, instead of a processor or business, is  liable to a financial institution for the 
damages described in (a) of this subsection to the extent that the damages were proximately 
caused by the vendor’s negligence and if the claim is not limited or foreclosed by another 
provision of law or by a contr act to which the financial institution is a party.  
(4)  Nothing in this section may be construed as preventing or foreclosing any entity responsible 
for handling account information on behalf of a business or processor from being made a party to 
an action under this section.  
(5)  Nothing in this section may be construed as preventing or foreclosing a processor, business, or 
vendor from asserting any defense otherwise available to it in an action including, but not limited 
to, defenses of contract, or of con tributory or comparative negligence.  
(6)  In cases to which this section applies, the trier of fact shall determine the percentage of the 
total fault which is attributable to every entity which was the proximate cause of the claimant’s 
damages.  
(7)  The re medies under this section are cumulative and do not restrict any other right or remedy 
otherwise available under law, however a trier of fact may reduce damages awarded to a financial 
institution by any amount the financial institution recovers from a cred it card company in 
connection with the breach, for costs associated with access card reissuance.

a law enforcement investigation by contacting the local law en forcement agency that has 
jurisdiction over the individual’s residence or any other jurisdiction in which any part of the 
offense occurred. The law enforcement agency shall take a report of the matter, provide the 
individual with a copy of that report, and  begin an investigation of the facts. If the suspected crime 
was committed in a different jurisdiction, the local law enforcement agency may refer the matter to 
the law enforcement agency where the suspected crime was committed for further investigation of  
the facts.  
2.  An individual who reasonably believes that the individual is the victim of identity theft may 
petition the district court in the county in which the alleged victim resides or in which the identity 
theft is alleged to have occurred, or the c ourt, on its own motion or upon application of the state’s 
attorney, may move for an expedited judicial determination of the individual’s factual innocence, 
if the perpetrator of the identity theft was arrested, cited, or convicted of a crime under the vic tim’s 
identity, if a criminal complaint has been filed against the perpetrator in the victim’s name, or if 
the victim’s identity has been mistakenly associated with a record of criminal conviction. Any 
judicial determination of factual innocence made under  this section may be heard and determined 
upon declarations, affidavits, police reports, or other material, relevant, and reliable information 
submitted by the parties or ordered to be part of the record by the court. If the court determines 
that the petit ion or motion is meritorious and that there is no reasonable cause to believe that the 
victim committed the offense for which the perpetrator of the identity theft was arrested, cited, 
convicted, or subject to a criminal complaint in the victim’s name, or that the victim’s identity has 
been mistakenly associated with a record of criminal conviction, the court shall find the victim 
factually innocent of that offense. If the victim is found factually innocent, the court shall issue an 
order certifying that de termination.  
3.  After a court has issued a determination of factual innocence under this section, the court may 
order the name and associated personal identifying information contained in court records, files, 
and indexes accessible by the public deleted,  sealed, or labeled to show that the data is 
impersonated and does not reflect the defendant’s identity.  
4.  A court that has issued a determination of factual innocence under this section may vacate that 
determination if the petition or any information su bmitted in support of the petition is found to
