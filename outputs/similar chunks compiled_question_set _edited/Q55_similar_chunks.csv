(h)Notwithstanding a business’s obligations to respond to and honor consumer rights requests 
pursuant to this title:
(1)A time period for a business to respond to a consumer for any verifiable consumer request 
may be extended by up to a total of 90 days where necessary, taking into account the complexity 
and number of the requests. The business shall inform the consumer of any such extension 
within 45 days of receipt of the request, together with the reasons for the delay.
(2)If the business does not take action on the request of the consumer, the business shall 
inform the consumer, without delay and at the latest within the time period permitted of 
response by this section, of the reasons for not taking action and any rights the consumer may 
have to appeal the decision to the business.
(3)If requests from a consumer are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of 
their repetitive character, a business may either charge a reasonable fee, taking into account the 
administrative costs of providing the information or communication or taking the action 
requested, or refuse to act on the request and notify the consumer of the reason for refusing the 
request. The business shall bear the burden of demonstrating that any verifiable consumer 
request is manifestly unfounded or excessive.
(i)  
(1)A business that discloses personal information to a service provider or contractor in 
compliance with this title shall not be liable under this title if the service provider or contractor 
receiving the personal information uses it in violation of the restrictions set forth in the title, 
provided that, at the time of disclosing the personal information, the business does not have 
actual knowledge, or reason to believe, that the service provider or contractor intends to commit 
such a violation. A service provider or contractor shall likewise not be liable under this title for 
the obligations of a business for which it provides services as set forth in this title provided that 
the service provider or contractor shall be liable for its own violations of this title.
(2)A business that discloses personal information of a consumer, with the exception of 
consumers who have exercised their right to opt out of the sale or sharing of their personal 
information, consumers who have limited the use or disclosure of their sensitive personal 
information, and minor consumers who have not opted in to the collection or sale of their 
personal information, to a third party pursuant to a written contract that requires the third party to 
provide the same level of protection of the consumer’s rights under this title as provided by the 
business shall not be liable under this title if the third party receiving the personal information 
uses it in violation of the restrictions set forth in this title provided that, at the time of disclosing 
the personal information, the business does not have actual knowledge, or reason to believe, that 
the third party intends to commit such a violation.
(j)This title shall not be construed to require a business, service provider, or contractor to:
(1)Reidentify or otherwise link information that, in the ordinary course of business, is not 
maintained in a manner that would be considered personal information.
(2)Retain any personal information about a consumer if, in the ordinary course of business, 
that information about the consumer would not be retained."

or access any data or technology, in order to be capable of linking or associating a verifiable 
consumer request with personal information.
(k)The rights afforded to consumers and the obligations imposed on the business in this title shall 
not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of other natural persons. A verifiable consumer request 
for specific pieces of personal information pursuant to Section 1798.110, to delete a consumer’s 
personal information pursuant to Section 1798.105, or to correct inaccurate personal information 
pursuant to Section 1798.106, shall not extend to personal information about the consumer that 
belongs to, or the business maintains on behalf of, another natural person. A business may rely on 
representations made in a verifiable consumer request as to rights with respect to personal 
information and is under no legal requirement to seek out other persons that may have or claim to 
have rights to personal information, and a business is under no legal obligation under this title or any 
other provision of law to take any action under this title in the event of a dispute between or among 
persons claiming rights to personal information in the business’s possession.
(l)The rights afforded to consumers and the obligations imposed on any business under this title 
shall not apply to the extent that they infringe on the noncommercial activities of a person or entity 
described in subdivision (b) of Section 2 of Article I of the California Constitution.

(A)Personal information that is collected by a business about a natural person in the course 
of the natural person acting as a job applicant to, an employee of, owner of, director of,

contractor of, that business.

51-31-04. Pol ice reports — Judicial determination of factual innocence.   
 
1.  An individual who has learned or reasonably suspects that the individual’s personal identifying 
information has been unlawfully used by another, as described in section 12.1 -23-11, may initiate 
a law enforcement investigation by contacting the local law en forcement agency that has 
jurisdiction over the individual’s residence or any other jurisdiction in which any part of the 
offense occurred. The law enforcement agency shall take a report of the matter, provide the 
individual with a copy of that report, and  begin an investigation of the facts. If the suspected crime 
was committed in a different jurisdiction, the local law enforcement agency may refer the matter to 
the law enforcement agency where the suspected crime was committed for further investigation of  
the facts.  
2.  An individual who reasonably believes that the individual is the victim of identity theft may 
petition the district court in the county in which the alleged victim resides or in which the identity 
theft is alleged to have occurred, or the c ourt, on its own motion or upon application of the state’s 
attorney, may move for an expedited judicial determination of the individual’s factual innocence, 
if the perpetrator of the identity theft was arrested, cited, or convicted of a crime under the vic tim’s 
identity, if a criminal complaint has been filed against the perpetrator in the victim’s name, or if 
the victim’s identity has been mistakenly associated with a record of criminal conviction. Any 
judicial determination of factual innocence made under  this section may be heard and determined 
upon declarations, affidavits, police reports, or other material, relevant, and reliable information 
submitted by the parties or ordered to be part of the record by the court. If the court determines 
that the petit ion or motion is meritorious and that there is no reasonable cause to believe that the 
victim committed the offense for which the perpetrator of the identity theft was arrested, cited, 
convicted, or subject to a criminal complaint in the victim’s name, or that the victim’s identity has 
been mistakenly associated with a record of criminal conviction, the court shall find the victim 
factually innocent of that offense. If the victim is found factually innocent, the court shall issue an 
order certifying that de termination.  
3.  After a court has issued a determination of factual innocence under this section, the court may 
order the name and associated personal identifying information contained in court records, files, 
and indexes accessible by the public deleted,  sealed, or labeled to show that the data is 
impersonated and does not reflect the defendant’s identity.  
4.  A court that has issued a determination of factual innocence under this section may vacate that 
determination if the petition or any information su bmitted in support of the petition is found to 
contain any material misrepresentation or fraud."
