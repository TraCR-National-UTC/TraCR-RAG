A.   
(1)  All entities providing security in compliance with R.S. 32:861 et seq., hereinafter referred 
to as “security providers”, whether admitted or nonadmitted (surplus line underwriter) 
insurance companies providing automobile liability policies, or sales representatives or agents 
of surety companies issuing motor vehicle liability bonds, or the state treasurer holding 
deposits, shall notify the secretary of the effective dates of each liability policy, liability bond , 
deposit, or other security within fifteen business days from the date that notice of such policy, 
bond, deposit, or other security was issued by the security provider.  
(2)  Except as otherwise provided for motor carriers in R.S. 32:900(M), in addition, all such 
security providers shall notify the secretary when any policy, bond, deposit, or other item of 
security is terminated, withdrawn, canceled, lapsed, or otherwise made ineffective within 
fifteen business days from the date that notice of the securit y becoming ineffective was issued 
by the security provider.  
(3)  Beginning January 1, 1990, the information required by this Section shall be in the form 
required by the secretary, who may require by regulation such information as the driver’s 
license numb er of the owner or lessee of the vehicle and of the named insureds, together with 
the complete vehicle identification number and a description of each vehicle.  
(4)  The information required by this Section shall be in the form required by the secretary, 
who may require by regulation such information as the driver’s license number of the owner or 
lessee of the vehicle and of the named insureds, together with the complete vehicle 
identification number and description of each vehicle.  
(5)  If any cancellation of a motor vehicle liability policy occurs at the request of the insured, 
the insurer is not obligated to cancel such policy earlier than ten days prior to actual receipt by 
the insurer of such request.  
(6)  If any cancellation of a motor vehicle liability  insurance policy occurs as a result of the 
rescission or other cancellation of the sale of the motor vehicle on which the policy is issued, 
the insurer shall notify the secretary of the cancellation and the circumstances of the"
137,,"Page 2 of 4 
La. R.S. § 32:863.2  
 Trayce Hockstad   cancellation, and the insur ed shall not be liable for any penalty or fee imposed for failure to 
maintain the security required by law.  
B.  When a security provider does not provide the deputy secretary of public safety services of the 
Department of Public Safety and Corrections with  the information required by this Section within 
the time limits set forth in this Section, the insurance company, sales representative or agent, state 
treasurer, or other provider shall pay a late fee of not more than fifty dollars per policy, bond, or 
deposit, or other security item concerning which information is not supplied. If the security 
provider has reported this information for a policy, bond, deposit, or other security item for a 
commercial motor vehicle in an untimely manner, the deputy secretar y shall impose the late fee 
unless the deputy secretary determines that the security provider made a good faith effort to 
comply with these requirements but the delay was caused by circumstances outside the security 
provider’s control. All fees collected u nder this Subsection shall be deposited in the Bond Security 
and Redemption Fund as provided in R.S. 32:853(B)(2).  
C.  The secretary shall keep a record of the information received from security providers 
concerning coverage of vehicles and persons by secu rity required by R.S. 32:861, which 
information may be stored through automated electronic data processing means. After the 
department has complete vehicle liability security records, upon written request including the 
driver’s license number for each pers on, the vehicle identification number for each vehicle, and the 
payment of a fee of fifteen dollars for each vehicle owned by a person about which inquiry is 
made, the secretary shall forward to the inquiring party such vehicle and driver liability securit y 
information as is contained in the records of the department. If the department’s search of its 
records fails to show the existence of any liability insurance or other security as of the date about 
which inquiry is made, an official of the department wil l issue a sworn, notarized affidavit to that 
effect. Such an affidavit shall be prima facie evidence that on the date in question, the person or 
vehicle about which inquiry was made did not have in effect a policy of liability insurance or other 
security a s required by law. The fee collected pursuant to this Section shall be remitted by the 
secretary to the state treasurer to be credited to the Bond Security and Redemption Fund as 
provided in R.S. 32:853(B)(2).  
D.  Notwithstanding any provision of law to th e contrary, when there is a question of fact as to the 
existence of liability insurance coverage on a motor vehicle, and the owner of that motor vehicle 
has in fact maintained that coverage without lapse, and the question results from a mistake made 
by an insurance company or agent, or by any other entity, the owner of the motor vehicle shall not 
be required to pay any reinstatement fee in connection with any actions taken based on that 
question of coverage. If a reinstatement fee is imposed by the state, t he reinstatement fee shall be 
paid by the agent, company, or other entity which made the mistake.  
E.   
(1)  Prior to taking any administrative action based on the receipt of a notice of cancellation of 
insurance or other security, the secretary shall notif y the person who is the subject of the notice 
at his last known driver’s license address, of cancellation of the receipt of that notice. The 
notice of receipt of a notice of cancellation shall be in writing. The notice shall inform the 
subject that he has ten calendar days from the date of the notice in which he may surrender the 
license plates of the vehicle in order to avoid the fees prescribed by R.S. 32:863(A)(3)(a). The 
person to whom the notice is addressed shall have thirty days to respond to the not ice. The 
response may be made by mail."

this section. Notice required by this section must be made in good faith, in the most  expedient 
time possible and without unreasonable delay, but not later than thirty days after the law 
enforcement agency determines that notification will no longer impede the investigation and

(2)  Processors, businesses, and vendors are not liable under this section if (a) the account 
information was encrypted at the time of the breach, or  (b) the processor, business, or vendor was 
certified compliant with the payment card industry data security standards adopted by the payment 
card industry security standards council, and in force at the time of the breach. A processor, 
business, or vendor  will be considered compliant, if its payment card industry data security 
compliance was validated by an annual security assessment, and if this assessment took place no 
more than one year prior to the time of the breach. For the purposes of this subsectio n (2), a 
processor, business, or vendor’s security assessment of compliance is nonrevocable. The 
nonrevocability of a processor, business, or vendor’s security assessment of compliance is only for 
the purpose of determining a processor, business, or vendor ’s liability under this subsection (2).  
(3)   
(a)  If a processor or business fails to take reasonable care to guard against unauthorized access 
to account information that is in the possession or under the control of the business or 
processor, and the fai lure is found to be the proximate cause of a breach, the processor or 
business is liable to a financial institution for reimbursement of reasonable actual costs related 
to the reissuance of credit cards and debit cards that are incurred by the financial in stitution to 
mitigate potential current or future damages to its credit card and debit card holders that reside 
in the state of Washington as a consequence of the breach, even if the financial institution has 
not suffered a physical injury in connection wi th the breach. In any legal action brought 
pursuant to this subsection, the prevailing party is entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys’ 
fees and costs incurred in connection with the legal action.  
(b)  A vendor, instead of a processor or business, is  liable to a financial institution for the 
damages described in (a) of this subsection to the extent that the damages were proximately 
caused by the vendor’s negligence and if the claim is not limited or foreclosed by another 
provision of law or by a contr act to which the financial institution is a party.  
(4)  Nothing in this section may be construed as preventing or foreclosing any entity responsible 
for handling account information on behalf of a business or processor from being made a party to 
an action under this section.  
(5)  Nothing in this section may be construed as preventing or foreclosing a processor, business, or 
vendor from asserting any defense otherwise available to it in an action including, but not limited

damages.

uses it in violation of the restrictions set forth in this title provided that, at the time of disclosing 
the personal information, the business does not have actual knowledge, or reason to believe, that 
the third party intends to commit such a violation.
(j)This title shall not be construed to require a business, service provider, or contractor to:
(1)Reidentify or otherwise link information that, in the ordinary course of business, is not 
maintained in a manner that would be considered personal information.
(2)Retain any personal information about a consumer if, in the ordinary course of business, 
that information about the consumer would not be retained."

51-31-04. Pol ice reports — Judicial determination of factual innocence.   
 
1.  An individual who has learned or reasonably suspects that the individual’s personal identifying 
information has been unlawfully used by another, as described in section 12.1 -23-11, may initiate 
a law enforcement investigation by contacting the local law en forcement agency that has 
jurisdiction over the individual’s residence or any other jurisdiction in which any part of the 
offense occurred. The law enforcement agency shall take a report of the matter, provide the 
individual with a copy of that report, and  begin an investigation of the facts. If the suspected crime 
was committed in a different jurisdiction, the local law enforcement agency may refer the matter to 
the law enforcement agency where the suspected crime was committed for further investigation of  
the facts.  
2.  An individual who reasonably believes that the individual is the victim of identity theft may 
petition the district court in the county in which the alleged victim resides or in which the identity 
theft is alleged to have occurred, or the c ourt, on its own motion or upon application of the state’s 
attorney, may move for an expedited judicial determination of the individual’s factual innocence, 
if the perpetrator of the identity theft was arrested, cited, or convicted of a crime under the vic tim’s 
identity, if a criminal complaint has been filed against the perpetrator in the victim’s name, or if 
the victim’s identity has been mistakenly associated with a record of criminal conviction. Any 
judicial determination of factual innocence made under  this section may be heard and determined 
upon declarations, affidavits, police reports, or other material, relevant, and reliable information 
submitted by the parties or ordered to be part of the record by the court. If the court determines 
that the petit ion or motion is meritorious and that there is no reasonable cause to believe that the 
victim committed the offense for which the perpetrator of the identity theft was arrested, cited, 
convicted, or subject to a criminal complaint in the victim’s name, or that the victim’s identity has 
been mistakenly associated with a record of criminal conviction, the court shall find the victim 
factually innocent of that offense. If the victim is found factually innocent, the court shall issue an 
order certifying that de termination.  
3.  After a court has issued a determination of factual innocence under this section, the court may 
order the name and associated personal identifying information contained in court records, files, 
and indexes accessible by the public deleted,  sealed, or labeled to show that the data is 
impersonated and does not reflect the defendant’s identity.  
4.  A court that has issued a determination of factual innocence under this section may vacate that 
determination if the petition or any information su bmitted in support of the petition is found to 
contain any material misrepresentation or fraud."
