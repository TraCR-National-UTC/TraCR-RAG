§ 220. Biometric Systems; Restrictions.   
 
(a)  As used  in this section, the following words shall, unless the context clearly requires 
otherwise, have the following meanings:  
“Biometric surveillance system”, any computer software that performs facial recognition or 
other remote biometric recognition.  
“Facial recognition”, an automated or semi -automated process that assists in identifying or 
verifying an individual or capturing information about an individual based on the physical 
characteristics of an individual’s face, head or body, that uses characteristics of an individual’s

provided, however, that “facial recognition” shall not include the use of search terms to sort 
images in a database.  
“Facial recognition search”, a computer search using facial recognition to attempt to identify 
an unidentified person by comparing an image containing the face of the unidentified person to

“Law enforcement agency”, as defined in section 1 of chapter 6E.  
“Other remote biometric recognition”, an automated or semi -automated process that assists in

“other remote biometric recognition” shall not include the identification or verification of an 
individual using deoxyribonucleic acid, fingerprints, palm prints or other information derived 
from physical contact.

recognition technology shall only do so through a written request submitted to the registrar of 
motor vehicles, the department of state police or the Federal Bureau of Investigation. A law 
enforcement agency may perform such a facial recognition search for the following purposes: (i) 
to execute an order, issued by a court or justice authorized to issue warrants in c riminal cases, 
based upon specific and articulable facts and reasonable inferences therefrom that provide 
reasonable grounds to believe that the information sought would be relevant and material to an 
ongoing criminal investigation or to mitigate a substan tial risk of harm to any individual or group 
of people; or (ii) without an order to identify a deceased person or if the law enforcement agency 
reasonably believes that an emergency involving substantial risk of harm to any individual or 
group of people re quires the performance of a facial recognition search without delay. Any 
emergency request shall be narrowly tailored to address the emergency and shall document the 
factual basis for believing that an emergency requires the performance of a facial recogni tion 
search without delay.  
This subsection shall not apply to the department of state police when performing investigatory 
functions related to the issuance of identification documents by the registrar of motor vehicles.

crime; (vii) the entity to which the request was submitted; and (viii) data detailing the individual 
characteristics included in the facial recognition request. Such documentation shall not be a public 
record, exce pt for as provided for in (d).  
(d)  Annually, not later than September 1, the executive office of public safety and security shall 
publish on its website documentation received from law enforcement agencies under subsection 
(c) and the following data for t he previous calendar year: (i) the total number of facial recognition 
search requests made by other law enforcement agencies to the department of state police, 
disaggregated by law enforcement agency; (ii) the total number of facial recognition searches 
performed by the department of state police, disaggregated by law enforcement agency on whose 
behalf the search was performed; (iii) the total number of facial recognition searches requested and 
performed by the state police; (iv) the total number of facial recognition search requests made by 
the department of state police to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, disaggregated by law 
enforcement agency on whose behalf the requests were made; and (v) the total number of facial 
recognition searches performed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation on behalf of Massachusetts 
law enforcement agencies, disaggregated by law enforcement agency on whose behalf the search 
was performed. For each category of data and each law enforcement agency, the published 
information shall specify the number of requests made or searches performed pursuant to a court 
order, the number of emergency requests made or searches performed, and the reason for 
requesting the search, including, but not limited to, any underlying suspected crime.

(1)  The secretary shall formulate criteria to develop and initiate a request for proposals to 
procure and implement a real -time system to quickly and accurately identify and verify the 
existence of motor vehicle insurance or other security required in compliance with the Motor 
Vehicle Safety Responsibility Law using advanced telecommunications and computer 
technology.  
(2)  The c riteria established by the secretary shall be developed only after consulting with an 
advisory group consisting of the commissioner of insurance or his designee, the superintendent 
of state police or his designee, the executive director of the Louisiana Hi ghway Safety 
Commission or his designee, and five additional members, one representing the American 
Insurance Association, one representing the Property Casualty Insurance Association of 
America, one selected from a list of names submitted by the three ins urers with the largest 
market share of automobile insurance in Louisiana, one from the Louisiana Association of Fire

the existence of motor vehicle insurance or other security required in this state as provided in 
the Motor Vehicle Safety R esponsibility Law.  
(4)  The system developed pursuant to this Subsection may initially be implemented by the 
secretary as a six -month pilot program to be developed and implemented statewide upon 
expiration of the six -month period.  
(5)  The secretary shall require such information as may be necessary from automobile insurers 
or their representatives and the state treasurer as is needed to assist the contractor in

maintain the security required by law.  
B.  When a security provider does not provide the deputy secretary of public safety services of the 
Department of Public Safety and Corrections with  the information required by this Section within 
the time limits set forth in this Section, the insurance company, sales representative or agent, state 
treasurer, or other provider shall pay a late fee of not more than fifty dollars per policy, bond, or 
deposit, or other security item concerning which information is not supplied. If the security 
provider has reported this information for a policy, bond, deposit, or other security item for a 
commercial motor vehicle in an untimely manner, the deputy secretar y shall impose the late fee 
unless the deputy secretary determines that the security provider made a good faith effort to 
comply with these requirements but the delay was caused by circumstances outside the security 
provider’s control. All fees collected u nder this Subsection shall be deposited in the Bond Security 
and Redemption Fund as provided in R.S. 32:853(B)(2).  
C.  The secretary shall keep a record of the information received from security providers 
concerning coverage of vehicles and persons by secu rity required by R.S. 32:861, which 
information may be stored through automated electronic data processing means. After the 
department has complete vehicle liability security records, upon written request including the 
driver’s license number for each pers on, the vehicle identification number for each vehicle, and the 
payment of a fee of fifteen dollars for each vehicle owned by a person about which inquiry is 
made, the secretary shall forward to the inquiring party such vehicle and driver liability securit y 
information as is contained in the records of the department. If the department’s search of its 
records fails to show the existence of any liability insurance or other security as of the date about 
which inquiry is made, an official of the department wil l issue a sworn, notarized affidavit to that 
effect. Such an affidavit shall be prima facie evidence that on the date in question, the person or 
vehicle about which inquiry was made did not have in effect a policy of liability insurance or other 
security a s required by law. The fee collected pursuant to this Section shall be remitted by the 
secretary to the state treasurer to be credited to the Bond Security and Redemption Fund as 
provided in R.S. 32:853(B)(2).  
D.  Notwithstanding any provision of law to th e contrary, when there is a question of fact as to the 
existence of liability insurance coverage on a motor vehicle, and the owner of that motor vehicle 
has in fact maintained that coverage without lapse, and the question results from a mistake made 
by an insurance company or agent, or by any other entity, the owner of the motor vehicle shall not 
be required to pay any reinstatement fee in connection with any actions taken based on that 
question of coverage. If a reinstatement fee is imposed by the state, t he reinstatement fee shall be 
paid by the agent, company, or other entity which made the mistake.  
E.   
(1)  Prior to taking any administrative action based on the receipt of a notice of cancellation of 
insurance or other security, the secretary shall notif y the person who is the subject of the notice 
at his last known driver’s license address, of cancellation of the receipt of that notice. The 
notice of receipt of a notice of cancellation shall be in writing. The notice shall inform the 
subject that he has ten calendar days from the date of the notice in which he may surrender the 
license plates of the vehicle in order to avoid the fees prescribed by R.S. 32:863(A)(3)(a). The 
person to whom the notice is addressed shall have thirty days to respond to the not ice. The 
response may be made by mail."

entity authorized to access the crash report under this section on whose behalf the third party 
has sought the report. This section shall not prevent an agency, pursuant to a memorandu m of 
understanding, from providing data derived from crash reports to a third party solely for the

such solicitation. Such written sworn statement must be completed and sworn to by the 
requesting party for each individual crash report that is being requested. In lieu of requiring the 
written sworn statement, an agency may provide crash reports by electronic means pursuant to 
a memorandum of understanding to third -party vendors under contract with one or more 
insurers, but only when such contract states that information from a crash rep ort made 
confidential and exempt by this section will not be used for any commercial solicitation of 
accident victims by the vendors, or knowingly disclosed by the vendors to any third party for 
the purpose of such solicitation,  and only when a copy of su ch contract is furnished to the

1.  An individual who has learned or reasonably suspects that the individual’s personal identifying 
information has been unlawfully used by another, as described in section 12.1 -23-11, may initiate 
a law enforcement investigation by contacting the local law en forcement agency that has 
jurisdiction over the individual’s residence or any other jurisdiction in which any part of the 
offense occurred. The law enforcement agency shall take a report of the matter, provide the 
individual with a copy of that report, and  begin an investigation of the facts. If the suspected crime 
was committed in a different jurisdiction, the local law enforcement agency may refer the matter to 
the law enforcement agency where the suspected crime was committed for further investigation of  
the facts.  
2.  An individual who reasonably believes that the individual is the victim of identity theft may 
petition the district court in the county in which the alleged victim resides or in which the identity 
theft is alleged to have occurred, or the c ourt, on its own motion or upon application of the state’s 
attorney, may move for an expedited judicial determination of the individual’s factual innocence, 
if the perpetrator of the identity theft was arrested, cited, or convicted of a crime under the vic tim’s 
identity, if a criminal complaint has been filed against the perpetrator in the victim’s name, or if 
the victim’s identity has been mistakenly associated with a record of criminal conviction. Any 
judicial determination of factual innocence made under  this section may be heard and determined 
upon declarations, affidavits, police reports, or other material, relevant, and reliable information 
submitted by the parties or ordered to be part of the record by the court. If the court determines 
that the petit ion or motion is meritorious and that there is no reasonable cause to believe that the 
victim committed the offense for which the perpetrator of the identity theft was arrested, cited, 
convicted, or subject to a criminal complaint in the victim’s name, or that the victim’s identity has 
been mistakenly associated with a record of criminal conviction, the court shall find the victim 
factually innocent of that offense. If the victim is found factually innocent, the court shall issue an 
order certifying that de termination.  
3.  After a court has issued a determination of factual innocence under this section, the court may 
order the name and associated personal identifying information contained in court records, files, 
and indexes accessible by the public deleted,  sealed, or labeled to show that the data is 
impersonated and does not reflect the defendant’s identity.  
4.  A court that has issued a determination of factual innocence under this section may vacate that 
determination if the petition or any information su bmitted in support of the petition is found to 
contain any material misrepresentation or fraud."
