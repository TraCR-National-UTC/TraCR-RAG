shall conduct in good faith a reasonable and prompt investigation to determine the likelihood 
that personal information has been or will be misused and shall give notice of a breach of the 
security of the system following discovery or notification of the security breach to a resident of 
this State whose personal information has been, or is reasonably believed to have been, 
acquired by an unauthorized person.  
B.  If any other person who maintains computerized data that includes personal information 
becomes aware of a breach of the security of the system, the person shall conduct in good fa ith 
a reasonable and prompt investigation to determine the likelihood that personal information 
has been or will be misused and shall give notice of a breach of the security of the system 
following discovery or notification of the security breach to a resi dent of this State if misuse of 
the personal information has occurred or if it is reasonably possible that misuse will occur.  
The notices required under paragraphs A and B must be made as expediently as possible and 
without unreasonable delay, consistent with the legitimate needs of law enforcement pursuant to 
subsection 3 or with measures necessary to determine the scope of the security breach and restore 
the reasonable integrity, security and confidentiality of the data in the system. If there is no delay 
of notification due to law enforcement investigation pursuant to subsection 3, the notices must be 
made no more than 30 days after the person identified in paragraph A or B becomes aware of a 
breach of security and identifies its scope.  
2. Notification to person maintaining personal information.  A 3rd -party entity that maintains, 
on behalf of a person, computerized data that i ncludes personal information that the 3rd -party 
entity does not own shall notify the person maintaining personal information of a breach of the 
security of the system immediately following discovery if the personal information was, or is 
reasonably believe d to have been, acquired by an unauthorized person.  
3. Delay of notification; criminal investigation by law enforcement.  If, after the completion of 
an investigation required by subsection 1, notification is required under this section, the"
111,,"Page 2 of 2 
10 M.R.S. § 1348  
 Trayce Hockstad   notification r equired by this section may be delayed for no longer than 7 business days after a law 
enforcement agency determines that the notification will not compromise a criminal investigation.  
4. Notification to consumer reporting agencies.  If a person discovers a  breach of the security of 
the system that requires notification to more than 1,000 persons at a single time, the person shall

procure and implement a real -time system to quickly and accurately identify and verify the 
existence of motor vehicle insurance or other security required in compliance with the Motor 
Vehicle Safety Responsibility Law using advanced telecommunications and computer 
technology.  
(2)  The c riteria established by the secretary shall be developed only after consulting with an 
advisory group consisting of the commissioner of insurance or his designee, the superintendent 
of state police or his designee, the executive director of the Louisiana Hi ghway Safety 
Commission or his designee, and five additional members, one representing the American 
Insurance Association, one representing the Property Casualty Insurance Association of 
America, one selected from a list of names submitted by the three ins urers with the largest 
market share of automobile insurance in Louisiana, one from the Louisiana Association of Fire 
and Casualty Companies, and one from the Louisiana Independent Agents Association.

or their representatives and the state treasurer as is needed to assist the contractor in 
developing the system as such relates to the cancellation or issuance of motor vehicle liability  
security or deposit of sufficient security with the state treasurer in order to operate a motor

B.  When a security provider does not provide the deputy secretary of public safety services of the 
Department of Public Safety and Corrections with  the information required by this Section within 
the time limits set forth in this Section, the insurance company, sales representative or agent, state 
treasurer, or other provider shall pay a late fee of not more than fifty dollars per policy, bond, or 
deposit, or other security item concerning which information is not supplied. If the security 
provider has reported this information for a policy, bond, deposit, or other security item for a 
commercial motor vehicle in an untimely manner, the deputy secretar y shall impose the late fee 
unless the deputy secretary determines that the security provider made a good faith effort to 
comply with these requirements but the delay was caused by circumstances outside the security 
provider’s control. All fees collected u nder this Subsection shall be deposited in the Bond Security 
and Redemption Fund as provided in R.S. 32:853(B)(2).  
C.  The secretary shall keep a record of the information received from security providers 
concerning coverage of vehicles and persons by secu rity required by R.S. 32:861, which 
information may be stored through automated electronic data processing means. After the 
department has complete vehicle liability security records, upon written request including the 
driver’s license number for each pers on, the vehicle identification number for each vehicle, and the 
payment of a fee of fifteen dollars for each vehicle owned by a person about which inquiry is 
made, the secretary shall forward to the inquiring party such vehicle and driver liability securit y 
information as is contained in the records of the department. If the department’s search of its 
records fails to show the existence of any liability insurance or other security as of the date about 
which inquiry is made, an official of the department wil l issue a sworn, notarized affidavit to that 
effect. Such an affidavit shall be prima facie evidence that on the date in question, the person or 
vehicle about which inquiry was made did not have in effect a policy of liability insurance or other 
security a s required by law. The fee collected pursuant to this Section shall be remitted by the 
secretary to the state treasurer to be credited to the Bond Security and Redemption Fund as 
provided in R.S. 32:853(B)(2).  
D.  Notwithstanding any provision of law to th e contrary, when there is a question of fact as to the 
existence of liability insurance coverage on a motor vehicle, and the owner of that motor vehicle 
has in fact maintained that coverage without lapse, and the question results from a mistake made 
by an insurance company or agent, or by any other entity, the owner of the motor vehicle shall not 
be required to pay any reinstatement fee in connection with any actions taken based on that 
question of coverage. If a reinstatement fee is imposed by the state, t he reinstatement fee shall be 
paid by the agent, company, or other entity which made the mistake.  
E.   
(1)  Prior to taking any administrative action based on the receipt of a notice of cancellation of 
insurance or other security, the secretary shall notif y the person who is the subject of the notice 
at his last known driver’s license address, of cancellation of the receipt of that notice. The 
notice of receipt of a notice of cancellation shall be in writing. The notice shall inform the 
subject that he has ten calendar days from the date of the notice in which he may surrender the 
license plates of the vehicle in order to avoid the fees prescribed by R.S. 32:863(A)(3)(a). The

measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and to restore the reasonable integrity 
of the computerized data system.  
(b)  In the case of a breach of personal information, notice required by this subsection (2) to 
affected Colorado residents must include, but need not be limited to, the following 
information:

needs of law enforcement and consistent with any me asures necessary to determine the scope 
of the breach and to restore the reasonable integrity of the computerized data system:

his or her password and security question  or answer, as applicable, or to take other steps 
appropriate to protect the online account with the person or business and all other online 
accounts for which the person whose personal information has been breached uses the 
same username or e -mail address  and password or security question or answer.  
(II)  For log -in credentials of an e -mail account furnished by the governmental entity, the 
governmental entity shall not comply with this section by providing the security breach 
notification to that e -mail a ddress, but may instead comply with this section by providing 
notice through other methods, as defined in subsection (1)(f) of this section, or by clear and 
conspicuous notice delivered to the resident online when the resident is connected to the 
online ac count from an internet protocol address or online location from which the 
governmental entity knows the resident customarily accesses the account.  
(d)  The breach of encrypted or otherwise secured personal information must be disclosed in 
accordance with this section if the confidential process, encryption key, or other means to"
169,,"Page 4 of 5

   decipher the secured information was also acquired in the security breach or was reasonably 
believed to have been acquired.  
(e)  A governmental entity that is required to provide notice pursuant to this subsection (2) is 
prohibited from charging the cost of providing such notice to individuals.  
(f)  Nothing in this subsection (2) prohibits the notice described in this subsection (2 ) from 
containing additional information, including any information that may be required by state or 
federal law.  
(g)  If a governmental entity uses a third -party service provider to maintain computerized data 
that includes personal information, then the third -party service provider shall give notice to and 
cooperate with the governmental entity in the event of a security breach that compromises such 
computerized data, including notifying the governmental entity of any security breach in the 
most expedient  time and without unreasonable delay following discovery of a security breach, 
if misuse of personal information about a Colorado resident occurred or is likely to occur. 
Cooperation includes sharing with the covered entity information relevant to the secu rity 
breach; except that such cooperation does not require the disclosure of confidential business

(h)  Notice required by this section may be delayed if a law enforcement agency determines 
that the notice will impede a crimi nal investigation and the law enforcement agency has 
notified the governmental entity that operates in Colorado not to send notice required by this 
section. Notice required by this section must be made in good faith, in the most expedient time 
possible and  without unreasonable delay, but not later than thirty days after the law 
enforcement agency determines that notification will no longer impede the investigation, and 
has notified the governmental entity that it is appropriate to send the notice required b y this 
section.  
(i)  If a governmental entity is required to notify more than one thousand Colorado residents of 
a security breach pursuant to this section, the governmental entity shall also notify, in the most 
expedient time possible and without unreaso nable delay, all consumer reporting agencies that 
compile and maintain files on consumers on a nationwide basis, as defined by the federal “Fair 
Credit Reporting Act”, 15 U.S.C. sec. 1681a (p), of the anticipated date of the notification to 
the residents a nd the approximate number of residents who are to be notified. Nothing in this 
subsection (2)(i) requires the governmental entity to provide to the consumer reporting agency 
the names or other personal information of security breach notice recipients. This  subsection 
(2)(i) does not apply to a person who is subject to Title V of the federal “Gramm -Leach -Bliley 
Act”, 15 U.S.C. sec. 6801 et seq.  
(j)  A waiver of these notification rights or responsibilities is void as against public policy.  
(k)   
(I)  The governmental entity that must notify Colorado residents of a data breach pursuant 
to this section shall provide notice of any security breach to the Colorado attorney general 
in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, but not l ater than

damages described in (a) of this subsection to the extent that the damages were proximately 
caused by the vendor’s negligence and if the claim is not limited or foreclosed by another 
provision of law or by a contr act to which the financial institution is a party.

1.  An individual who has learned or reasonably suspects that the individual’s personal identifying 
information has been unlawfully used by another, as described in section 12.1 -23-11, may initiate 
a law enforcement investigation by contacting the local law en forcement agency that has 
jurisdiction over the individual’s residence or any other jurisdiction in which any part of the 
offense occurred. The law enforcement agency shall take a report of the matter, provide the 
individual with a copy of that report, and  begin an investigation of the facts. If the suspected crime 
was committed in a different jurisdiction, the local law enforcement agency may refer the matter to 
the law enforcement agency where the suspected crime was committed for further investigation of  
the facts.  
2.  An individual who reasonably believes that the individual is the victim of identity theft may 
petition the district court in the county in which the alleged victim resides or in which the identity 
theft is alleged to have occurred, or the c ourt, on its own motion or upon application of the state’s 
attorney, may move for an expedited judicial determination of the individual’s factual innocence, 
if the perpetrator of the identity theft was arrested, cited, or convicted of a crime under the vic tim’s 
identity, if a criminal complaint has been filed against the perpetrator in the victim’s name, or if 
the victim’s identity has been mistakenly associated with a record of criminal conviction. Any 
judicial determination of factual innocence made under  this section may be heard and determined 
upon declarations, affidavits, police reports, or other material, relevant, and reliable information 
submitted by the parties or ordered to be part of the record by the court. If the court determines 
that the petit ion or motion is meritorious and that there is no reasonable cause to believe that the 
victim committed the offense for which the perpetrator of the identity theft was arrested, cited, 
convicted, or subject to a criminal complaint in the victim’s name, or that the victim’s identity has 
been mistakenly associated with a record of criminal conviction, the court shall find the victim 
factually innocent of that offense. If the victim is found factually innocent, the court shall issue an 
order certifying that de termination.  
3.  After a court has issued a determination of factual innocence under this section, the court may 
order the name and associated personal identifying information contained in court records, files, 
and indexes accessible by the public deleted,  sealed, or labeled to show that the data is 
impersonated and does not reflect the defendant’s identity.  
4.  A court that has issued a determination of factual innocence under this section may vacate that 
determination if the petition or any information su bmitted in support of the petition is found to 
contain any material misrepresentation or fraud."
