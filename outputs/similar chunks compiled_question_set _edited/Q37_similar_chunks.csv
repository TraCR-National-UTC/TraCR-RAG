(h)Notwithstanding a business’s obligations to respond to and honor consumer rights requests 
pursuant to this title:
(1)A time period for a business to respond to a consumer for any verifiable consumer request 
may be extended by up to a total of 90 days where necessary, taking into account the complexity 
and number of the requests. The business shall inform the consumer of any such extension 
within 45 days of receipt of the request, together with the reasons for the delay.
(2)If the business does not take action on the request of the consumer, the business shall 
inform the consumer, without delay and at the latest within the time period permitted of 
response by this section, of the reasons for not taking action and any rights the consumer may 
have to appeal the decision to the business.
(3)If requests from a consumer are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of 
their repetitive character, a business may either charge a reasonable fee, taking into account the 
administrative costs of providing the information or communication or taking the action 
requested, or refuse to act on the request and notify the consumer of the reason for refusing the 
request. The business shall bear the burden of demonstrating that any verifiable consumer 
request is manifestly unfounded or excessive.
(i)  
(1)A business that discloses personal information to a service provider or contractor in 
compliance with this title shall not be liable under this title if the service provider or contractor 
receiving the personal information uses it in violation of the restrictions set forth in the title, 
provided that, at the time of disclosing the personal information, the business does not have 
actual knowledge, or reason to believe, that the service provider or contractor intends to commit 
such a violation. A service provider or contractor shall likewise not be liable under this title for 
the obligations of a business for which it provides services as set forth in this title provided that 
the service provider or contractor shall be liable for its own violations of this title.
(2)A business that discloses personal information of a consumer, with the exception of 
consumers who have exercised their right to opt out of the sale or sharing of their personal 
information, consumers who have limited the use or disclosure of their sensitive personal 
information, and minor consumers who have not opted in to the collection or sale of their 
personal information, to a third party pursuant to a written contract that requires the third party to 
provide the same level of protection of the consumer’s rights under this title as provided by the 
business shall not be liable under this title if the third party receiving the personal information 
uses it in violation of the restrictions set forth in this title provided that, at the time of disclosing 
the personal information, the business does not have actual knowledge, or reason to believe, that 
the third party intends to commit such a violation.
(j)This title shall not be construed to require a business, service provider, or contractor to:
(1)Reidentify or otherwise link information that, in the ordinary course of business, is not 
maintained in a manner that would be considered personal information.
(2)Retain any personal information about a consumer if, in the ordinary course of business, 
that information about the consumer would not be retained."

notified purposes, for which businesses, service providers, and contractors may use consumers’ 
personal information consistent with consumers’ expectations, and further defining the business 
purposes for which service providers and contractors may combine consumers’ personal 
information obtained from different sources, except as provided for in paragraph (6) of 
subdivision (e) of Section 1798.140.
(11)Issuing regulations identifying those business purposes, including other notified purposes,

business purposes, with the goal of maximizing consumer privacy.

consumer” with the goal of maximizing a consumer’s right to access relevant personal 
information while minimizing the delivery of information to a consumer that would not be useful

most sensitive personal information, the regulations may require a higher standard of 
authentication provided that the agency shall monitor the impact of the higher standard on the 
right of consumers to obtain their personal information to ensure that the requirements of 
verification do not result in the unreasonable denial of verifiable consumer requests.
(15)Issuing regulations requiring businesses whose processing of consumers’ personal 
information presents significant risk to consumers’ privacy or security, to:
(A)Perform a cybersecurity audit on an annual basis, including defining the scope of the 
audit and establishing a process to ensure that audits are thorough and independent. The 
factors to be considered in determining when processing may result in significant risk to the 
security of personal information shall include the size and complexity of the business and 
the nature and scope of processing activities.
(B)Submit to the California Privacy Protection Agency on a regular basis a risk assessment 
with respect to their processing of personal information, including whether the processing 
involves sensitive personal information, and identifying and weighing the benefits resulting 
from the processing to the business, the consumer, other stakeholders, and the public, against 
the potential risks to the rights of the consumer associated with that processing, with the goal 
of restricting or prohibiting the processing if the risks to privacy of the consumer outweigh 
the benefits resulting from processing to the consumer, the business, other stakeholders, and 
the public. Nothing in this section shall require a business to divulge trade secrets.
