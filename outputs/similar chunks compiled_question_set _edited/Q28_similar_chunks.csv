(1)  malicious reconnaissance, including, but not limited to, anomalous patterns of 
communication that appear to be transmitted for the purpose of gathering technical 
information related to a cybersecurity threat or vulnerability;  
(2)  a method of defeating a security control or exploitation of a security vulnerability;  
(3)  a security vulnerability, including, but not limited to, anomalous activity that appears 
to indicate  the existence of a security vulnerability;  
(4)  a method of causing a user with legitimate access to an information system or 
information that is stored on, processed by, or transiting an information system to 
unwittingly enable the defeat of a security control or exploitation of a security 
vulnerability;  
(5)  malicious cyber command and control;  
(6)  the actual or potential harm caused by an incident, including but not limited to, a

cooperation, including  the voluntary sharing of information and analysis regarding 
cybersecurity  threats, among local, state and federa l agencies and across a broad  spectrum of

8.  Institutions of higher education play  a critical role in protecting and securing statewide 
cyberinfrastructure  by developing programs that support a skilled workforce, promote  
innovation  and contribute to a more secure statewide cyberinfrastructure.

whose security audit results and plans for corrective action are unacceptable, the CIO shall 
report such results to (i) the Secretary, (ii) any other affected cabinet secretary, (iii) the 
Governor, and (iv) the Auditor of Public Accounts. Upon review of the security audit results in

§ 39:15.11. Legislative intent   
 
The legislature of Louisiana hereby finds all of the following:  
(1)  The mission of the Louisiana Cybersecurity Commission, which was created by executive 
order of the governor, is the coordination of cybersecurity  efforts among local, state, tribal, and 
federal governments as well as the private sector to maintain the stability of public services 
while ensuring proper privacy and protection of data entrusted to the state.  
(2)  Information systems, networks, and cri tical infrastructure around the world are threatened 
by increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks.  
(3)  Cyberattacks aimed at breaching and damaging computers, networks, and critical 
infrastructure in Louisiana represent a major security risk and increase th e state’s vulnerability 
to economic disruption, critical infrastructure damage, privacy violations, and identity theft.  
(4)  The increasing number and complexity of cyberattacks demand heightened levels of 
coordination, information sharing, and emergency r esponse between local, state, tribal, and 
federal governments and the private sector to protect computer networks and critical 
infrastructure, as defined by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency of the 
federal Department of Homeland Security , from damage or unauthorized access.  
(5)  As a result of the increasing threat of cyberattacks and to solidify the collaboration 
between governments and the private sector, the Louisiana Cybersecurity Commission shall be 
formally created to ensure continu ation of its important mission. The commission’s proven 
track record of improving the resiliency of the cyber ecosystems in the state of Louisiana 
justify and warrant its statutory creation.
