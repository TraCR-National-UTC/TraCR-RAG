24-33.5-1901. Legislative declaration.   
 
(1)  The general assembly hereby finds and declares that:  
(a)  Cyber threats have continued to grow in significance, scale, scope, and sophistication in 
the past several years;  
(b)  A dramatic increase in the number of cyber attacks against public, private, a nd nonprofit 
entities and individual citizens, coupled with inadequate resources to respond to such attacks, 
have made cybersecurity a top priority;  
(c)  Colorado is well -suited to serve as a location for comprehensive cross -sector and interstate 
strategy  to support the response against these attacks and the education and training needed to 
prepare government and private sector leaders to respond to these attacks;  
(d)  It is in the state’s interest to support a partnership of academics and systems excelle nce at 
the university of Colorado at Colorado Springs and other institutions of higher education that 
can leverage the military, federal, state, and local government, and private sector assets in 
Colorado to support the cybersecurity of our state and local  governments and to support the 
cybersecurity of federal partners and other states and local governments across the country; 
and  
(e)  It is also in the state’s interest to support such a partnership as a tool to ensure that 
Colorado’s private sector is better prepared to respond to threats and in turn make Colorado a 
stronger hub for the cyber industry and the commercialization of cyber technology.  
(2)  The general assembly further finds and declares that the intent of this part 19 is to identify 
specific actions to define and improve cybersecurity, including the creation of a Colorado 
cybersecurity council, coordinating cyber operations  centers, establishing or expanding cyber 
higher education programs to promote education, training, and workforce development for 
cybersecurity, establishing a secure environment for research and development, and establishing a 
revenue source to support su ch efforts.

notified purposes, for which businesses, service providers, and contractors may use consumers’ 
personal information consistent with consumers’ expectations, and further defining the business 
purposes for which service providers and contractors may combine consumers’ personal 
information obtained from different sources, except as provided for in paragraph (6) of

consumer” with the goal of maximizing a consumer’s right to access relevant personal 
information while minimizing the delivery of information to a consumer that would not be useful

audit and establishing a process to ensure that audits are thorough and independent. The 
factors to be considered in determining when processing may result in significant risk to the 
security of personal information shall include the size and complexity of the business and 
the nature and scope of processing activities.
(B)Submit to the California Privacy Protection Agency on a regular basis a risk assessment 
with respect to their processing of personal information, including whether the processing 
involves sensitive personal information, and identifying and weighing the benefits resulting 
from the processing to the business, the consumer, other stakeholders, and the public, against 
the potential risks to the rights of the consumer associated with that processing, with the goal 
of restricting or prohibiting the processing if the risks to privacy of the consumer outweigh 
the benefits resulting from processing to the consumer, the business, other stakeholders, and 
the public. Nothing in this section shall require a business to divulge trade secrets.
