cooperation, including  the voluntary sharing of information and analysis regarding 
cybersecurity  threats, among local, state and federa l agencies and across a broad  spectrum of 
the public and private sectors.  
8.  Institutions of higher education play  a critical role in protecting and securing statewide 
cyberinfrastructure  by developing programs that support a skilled workforce, promote  
innovation  and contribute to a more secure statewide cyberinfrastructure.  
9.  It is therefore in the public interest  that the Legislature enact provisions to enable the State 
to prepare  for and mitigate risks to, and otherwise protect, information syst ems  and statewide 
cyberinfrastructure.

encryption key could render that personal information readable or useable.  
(2)  “Determination of the breach of security” means  the point in time at which a person who 
owns, licenses, or maintains computerized data has sufficient evidence to conclude that a 
breach of security of such computerized data has taken place.

indecipherable through a security technology or methodology generally accepted in the field of 
information security.  
(4)  “Encryption key” means the confidential key or process designed to render the encrypted

personal information consistent with consumers’ expectations, and further defining the business

information obtained from different sources, except as provided for in paragraph (6) of 
subdivision (e) of Section 1798.140.
(11)Issuing regulations identifying those business purposes, including other notified purposes,

(14)Issuing regulations to define the term “specific pieces of information obtained from the 
consumer” with the goal of maximizing a consumer’s right to access relevant personal 
information while minimizing the delivery of information to a consumer that would not be useful 
to the consumer, including system log information and other technical data. For delivery of the 
most sensitive personal information, the regulations may require a higher standard of 
authentication provided that the agency shall monitor the impact of the higher standard on the 
right of consumers to obtain their personal information to ensure that the requirements of 
verification do not result in the unreasonable denial of verifiable consumer requests.
(15)Issuing regulations requiring businesses whose processing of consumers’ personal 
information presents significant risk to consumers’ privacy or security, to:
(A)Perform a cybersecurity audit on an annual basis, including defining the scope of the 
audit and establishing a process to ensure that audits are thorough and independent. The 
factors to be considered in determining when processing may result in significant risk to the 
security of personal information shall include the size and complexity of the business and 
the nature and scope of processing activities.
(B)Submit to the California Privacy Protection Agency on a regular basis a risk assessment 
with respect to their processing of personal information, including whether the processing 
involves sensitive personal information, and identifying and weighing the benefits resulting 
from the processing to the business, the consumer, other stakeholders, and the public, against 
the potential risks to the rights of the consumer associated with that processing, with the goal 
of restricting or prohibiting the processing if the risks to privacy of the consumer outweigh 
the benefits resulting from processing to the consumer, the business, other stakeholders, and 
the public. Nothing in this section shall require a business to divulge trade secrets.

(iv)Ensuring that the exemption in subdivision (d) of Section 1798.121 for sensitive 
personal information applies to information that is collected or processed incidentally, or

1798.121.

(b) of Section 1798.135 responds to the opt-out preference signal and provides consumers with 
the opportunity subsequently to consent to the sale or sharing of their personal information or the 
use and disclosure of their sensitive personal information for purposes in addition to those 
authorized by subdivision (a) of Section 1798.121. The regulations should:
(A)Strive to promote competition and consumer choice and be technology neutral.
(B)Ensure that the business does not respond to an opt-out preference signal by:
(i)Intentionally degrading the functionality of the consumer experience.
(ii)Charging the consumer a fee in response to the consumer’s opt-out preferences.
(iii)Making any products or services not function properly or fully for the consumer, as 
compared to consumers who do not use the opt-out preference signal.
(iv)Attempting to coerce the consumer to opt in to the sale or sharing of the consumer’s 
personal information, or the use or disclosure of the consumer’s sensitive personal 
information, by stating or implying that the use of the opt-out preference signal will 
adversely affect the consumer as compared to consumers who do not use the opt-out 
preference signal, including stating or implying that the consumer will not be able to 
use the business’s products or services or that those products or services may not 
function properly or fully.

out preference signal sent by a platform, technology, or mechanism, to indicate a 
consumer’s intent to opt out of the sale or sharing of the consumer’s personal information 
and to limit the use or disclosure of the consumer’s sensitive personal information. The 
requirements and specifications for the opt-out preference signal should be updated from 
time to time to reflect the means by which consumers interact with businesses, and should:
(i)Ensure that the manufacturer of a platform or browser or device that sends the opt- 
out preference signal cannot unfairly disadvantage another business.
(ii)Ensure that the opt-out preference signal is consumer-friendly, clearly described, and 
easy to use by an average consumer and does not require that the consumer provide 
additional information beyond what is necessary.

personal information, without affecting the consumer’s preferences with respect to other 
businesses or disabling the opt-out preference signal globally.
(vi)State that in the case of a page or setting view that the consumer accesses to set the 
opt-out preference signal, the consumer should see up to three choices, including:
(I)Global opt out from sale and sharing of personal information, including a
