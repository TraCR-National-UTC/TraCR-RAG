cooperation, including  the voluntary sharing of information and analysis regarding 
cybersecurity  threats, among local, state and federa l agencies and across a broad  spectrum of 
the public and private sectors.  
8.  Institutions of higher education play  a critical role in protecting and securing statewide 
cyberinfrastructure  by developing programs that support a skilled workforce, promote  
innovation  and contribute to a more secure statewide cyberinfrastructure.  
9.  It is therefore in the public interest  that the Legislature enact provisions to enable the State 
to prepare  for and mitigate risks to, and otherwise protect, information syst ems  and statewide 
cyberinfrastructure.
