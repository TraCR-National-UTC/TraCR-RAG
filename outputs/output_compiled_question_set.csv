Notification of security breaches is a critical aspect of data protection laws across states. In Colorado, under C.R.S. 6-1-716, a covered entity must conduct a prompt investigation when it becomes aware of a security breach, determine the likelihood of misuse of personal information, and provide notice to affected Colorado residents. The notice should include specific information such as the date or range of the breach, details of the information acquired, contact information for the covered entity, and resources for affected residents to address potential fraud or security issues. Additionally, if the breach involves personal information like usernames, passwords, or financial information, the covered entity must guide the affected individuals on steps to protect their online accounts and cooperate with any third-party service providers involved.

New York:
The general reporting requirements for data breaches across states include the following key points:

1. Any state entity that owns or licenses computerized data containing private information must disclose any breach of the security system to affected individuals promptly and without unreasonable delay. This disclosure must be consistent with law enforcement needs and necessary measures to address the breach. The state entity is also required to consult with the state office of information technology services to determine the breach's scope and necessary restoration actions. Within ninety days of the breach notification, a report on the breach's scope and recommendations for restoring and enhancing system security must be delivered to the state entity.

2. If the exposure of private information results from an inadvertent disclosure by authorized personnel and is unlikely to lead to misuse, financial harm, or emotional harm, notice to affected persons may not be required, provided it is duly documented. In cases where over five hundred New York residents are affected, the written determination must be provided to the state attorney general within ten days.

3. The notification methods for affected persons include written notice, electronic notice (with consent), telephone notification, or substitute notice if certain conditions are met. Regardless of the method used, the notice must include contact information for the notifying state entity, relevant state and federal agencies providing security breach response and identity theft prevention information, and details of the breached information elements.

General reporting requirements for data breaches across states involve disclosing any breach of the security of a computerized personal information system to affected residents in an expedient time possible, typically within 45 days of discovery or notification of the breach. The disclosure can be made through various methods such as written notice, electronic notice, telephone notice, or substitute notice if certain conditions are met. Additionally, there are provisions for delaying disclosures if law enforcement agencies deem it necessary to avoid impeding investigations or compromising security. In cases involving a large number of affected residents in a single occurrence, notifying consumer reporting agencies is also mandated without unreasonable delay (""<a href= ""static/Current Cybersecurity Law\Ohio\Data Breach Notification\_ 1349.19 Disclosure or notification of.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Current Cybersecurity Law\Ohio\Data Breach Notification\_ 1349.19 Disclosure or notification of.pdf</a>"").
