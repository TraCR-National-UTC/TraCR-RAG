), \nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (  3 ), \nWhereas:  \n(1)  Network and information systems and electronic communications networks and services play a vital role in society \nand have become the backbone of economic growth. Information and communications technology (ICT) \nunderpins the complex systems which support everyday societal activities, keep our economies running in key \nsectors such as health, energy, finance and transport, and, in particular, support the functioning of the internal \nmarket.  \n(2)  The use of network and information systems by citizens, organisations and businesses across the Union is now \npervasive. Digitisation and connectivity are becoming core features in an ever growing number of products and \nservices and with the advent of the internet of Things (IoT) an extremely high number of connected digital devices \nare expected to be deployed across the Union during the next decade. While an increasing number of devices is \nconnected to the internet, security and resilience are not sufficiently built in by design, leading to insufficient \ncybersecurity. In that context, the limited use of certification leads to individual, organisational and business users \nhaving insufficient information about the cybersecurity features of ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes, \nwhich undermines trust in digital solutions. Network and information systems are capable of supporting all aspects \nof our lives and drive the Union\u2019s economic growth. They are the cornerstone for achieving the digital single \nmarket.  \n(3)  Increased digitisation and connectivity increase cybersecurity risks, thus making society as a whole more vulnerable \nto cyber threats and exacerbating the dangers faced by individuals, including vulnerable persons such as children. \nIn order to mitigate those risks, all necessary actions need to be taken to improve cybersecurity in the Union so \nthat network and information systems, communications networks, digital products, services and devices used by \ncitizens, organisations and businesses \u2013 ranging from small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), as defined in \nCommission Recommendation 2003/361/EC (  4 ), to operators of critical infrastructure \u2013 are better protected from \ncyber threats.EN  7.6.2019 Official Journal of the European Union L 151/15  \n( 1 ) OJ C 227, 28.6.2018, p. 86.  \n( 2 ) OJ C 176, 23.5.2018, p. 29.  \n( 3 ) Position of the European Parliament of 12 March 2019 (not yet published in the Official Journal) and decision of the Council of \n9 April 2019.  \n( 4 ) Commission Recommendation of 6 May 2003 concerning the definition of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (OJ L 124, \n20.5.2003, p. 36).", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3504, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bac4e006-6c39-4fff-8ae7-a6be7868355e": {"__data__": {"id_": "bac4e006-6c39-4fff-8ae7-a6be7868355e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "CELEX_32019R0881_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\User\\Box\\UTD\\PhD Research\\RAG-app\\Current Cybersecurity Law\\International\\International\\Cybersecurity Act\\CELEX_32019R0881_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 885350, "creation_date": "2024-06-05", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1499f06e-e7dc-4a35-836c-b022a5aefec1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "CELEX_32019R0881_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\User\\Box\\UTD\\PhD Research\\RAG-app\\Current Cybersecurity Law\\International\\International\\Cybersecurity Act\\CELEX_32019R0881_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 885350, "creation_date": "2024-06-05", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-03"}, "hash": "6c1164ba7cbe4ad985f731c50ab477bd9bd3956e6cd1de526edd23f3b0240c09", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "400190d2-7be7-4e3b-8167-f73dc2d843a2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "CELEX_32019R0881_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\User\\Box\\UTD\\PhD Research\\RAG-app\\Current Cybersecurity Law\\International\\International\\Cybersecurity Act\\CELEX_32019R0881_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 885350, "creation_date": "2024-06-05", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-03"}, "hash": "4adf8dd5637cfb96de7d911706a1e5ce5c65278cdfdea5020110d40c19f69226", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "82bc7ec9-59e2-4bef-945e-4dce5210b458", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6ba5937e36087e1601de62928dc01feb2dedb1e993c46c7ffecc4666c8664959", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "(4)  By making the relevant information available to the public, the European Union Agency for Network and \nInformation Security (ENISA), as established by Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 of the European Parliament and \nof the Council (  5 ) contributes to the development of the cybersecurity industry in the Union, in particular SMEs \nand start-ups. ENISA should strive for closer cooperation with universities and research entities in order to \ncontribute to reducing dependence on cybersecurity products and services from outside the Union and to \nreinforce supply chains inside the Union.  \n(5)  Cyberattacks are on the increase and a connected economy and society that is more vulnerable to cyber threats \nand attacks requires stronger defences. However, while cyberattacks often take place across borders, the \ncompetence of, and policy responses by, cybersecurity and law enforcement authorities are predominantly \nnational. Large-scale incidents could disrupt the provision of essential services across the Union. This necessitates \neffective and coordinated responses and crisis management at Union level, building on dedicated policies and wider \ninstruments for European solidarity and mutual assistance. Moreover, a regular assessment of the state of cyberse \u00ad\ncurity and resilience in the Union, based on reliable Union data, as well as systematic forecasts of future devel \u00ad\nopments, challenges and threats, at Union and global level, are important for policy makers, industry and users.  \n(6)  In light of the increased cybersecurity challenges faced by the Union, there is a need for a comprehensive set of \nmeasures that would build on previous Union action and would foster mutually reinforcing objectives. Those \nobjectives include further increasing the capabilities and preparedness of Member States and businesses, as well as \nimproving cooperation, information sharing and coordination across Member States and Union institutions, \nbodies, offices and agencies. Furthermore, given the borderless nature of cyber threats, there is a need to \nincrease capabilities at Union level that could complement the action of Member States, in particular in cases \nof large-scale cross-border incidents and crises, while taking into account the importance of maintaining and \nfurther enhancing the national capabilities to respond to cyber threats of all scales.  \n(7)  Additional efforts are also needed to increase citizens\u2019, organisations\u2019 and businesses\u2019 awareness of cybersecurity \nissues. Moreover, given that incidents undermine trust in digital service providers and in the digital single market \nitself, especially among consumers, trust should be further strengthened by offering information in a transparent \nmanner on the level of security of ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes that stresses that even a high level \nof cybersecurity certification cannot guarantee that an ICT product, ICT service or ICT process is completely secure. \nAn increase in trust can be facilitated by Union-wide certification providing for common cybersecurity \nrequirements and evaluation criteria across national markets and sectors.  \n(8)  Cybersecurity is not only an issue related to technology, but one where human behaviour is equally important. \nTherefore, \u2018cyber-hygiene\u2019, namely, simple, routine measures that, where implemented and carried out regularly by \ncitizens, organisations and businesses, minimise their exposure to risks from cyber threats, should be strongly \npromoted.  \n(9)  For the purpose of strengthening Union cybersecurity structures, it is important to maintain and develop the \ncapabilities of Member States to comprehensively respond to cyber threats, including to cross-border incidents.  \n(10)  Businesses and individual consumers should have accurate information regarding the assurance level with which \nthe security of their ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes has been certified. At the same time, no ICT \nproduct or ICT service is wholly cyber-secure and basic rules of cyber-hygiene have to be promoted and prioritised. \nGiven the growing availability of IoT devices, there is a range of voluntary measures that the private sector can take \nto reinforce trust in the security of ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes.  \n(11)  Modern ICT products and systems often integrate and rely on one or more third-party technologies and \ncomponents such as software modules, libraries or application programming interfaces.

Against that background and in the context of the positive development of the role \nof ENISA as a reference point for advice and expertise, as a facilitator of cooperation and of capacity-building as \nwell as within the framework of the new Union cybersecurity policy, it is necessary to review ENISA\u2019s mandate, to \nestablish its role in the changed cybersecurity ecosystem and to ensure that it contributes effectively to the Union\u2019s \nresponse to cybersecurity challenges emanating from the radically transformed cyber threat landscape, for which, as \nrecognised during the evaluation of ENISA, the current mandate is not sufficient.  \n(17)  ENISA as established by this Regulation should succeed ENISA as established by Regulation (EU) No 526/2013. \nENISA should carry out the tasks conferred on it by this Regulation and other legal acts of the Union in the field \nof cybersecurity, among other things, by providing advice and expertise and by acting as a Union centre of \ninformation and knowledge. It should promote the exchange of best practices between Member States and \nprivate stakeholders, offer policy suggestions to the Commission and the Member States, act as a reference \npoint for Union sectoral policy initiatives with regard to cybersecurity matters, and foster operational cooperation, \nboth between Member States and between the Member States and Union institutions, bodies, office and agencies.  \n(18)  Within the framework of Decision 2004/97/EC, Euratom taken by common agreement between the Represen \u00ad\ntatives of the Member States, meeting at Head of State or Government level (  13 ), the representatives of the Member \nStates decided that ENISA would have its seat in a town in Greece to be determined by the Greek Government. \nENISA\u2019s host Member State should ensure the best possible conditions for the smooth and efficient operation of \nENISA. It is imperative for the proper and efficient performance of its tasks, for staff recruitment and retention and \nfor enhancing the efficiency of networking activities that ENISA be based in an appropriate location, among other \nthings providing appropriate transport connections and facilities for spouses and children accompanying members \nof staff of ENISA. The necessary arrangements should be laid down in an agreement between ENISA and the host \nMember State concluded after obtaining the approval of the Management Board of ENISA.  \n(19)  Given the increasing cybersecurity risks and challenges the Union is facing, the financial and human resources \nallocated to ENISA should be increased to reflect its enhanced role and tasks, and its critical position in the \necosystem of organisations defending the digital ecosystem of the Union, allowing ENISA to effectively carry out \nthe tasks conferred on it by this Regulation.  \n(20)  ENISA should develop and maintain a high level of expertise and operate as a reference point, establishing trust \nand confidence in the single market by virtue of its independence, the quality of the advice it delivers, the quality \nof information it disseminates, the transparency of its procedures, the transparency of its methods of operation, \nand its diligence in carrying out its tasks. ENISA should actively support national efforts and should proactively \ncontribute to Union efforts while carrying out its tasks in full cooperation with the Union institutions, bodies, \noffices and agencies and with the Member States, avoiding any duplication of work and promoting synergy. In \naddition, ENISA should build on input from and cooperation with the private sector as well as other relevant \nstakeholders. A set of tasks should establish how ENISA is to accomplish its objectives while allowing flexibility in \nits operations.  \n(21)  In order to be able to provide adequate support to the operational cooperation between Member States, ENISA \nshould further strengthen its technical and human capabilities and skills. ENISA should increase its know-how and \ncapabilities.

ENISA should \nsupport the security of the public core of the open internet and the stability of its functioning, including, but not \nlimited to, key protocols (in particular DNS, BGP, and IPv6), the operation of the domain name system (such as the \noperation of all top-level domains), and the operation of the root zone.  \n(24)  The underlying task of ENISA is to promote the consistent implementation of the relevant legal framework, in \nparticular the effective implementation of Directive (EU) 2016/1148 and other relevant legal instruments \ncontaining cybersecurity aspects, which is essential to increasing cyber resilience. In light of the fast evolving \ncyber threat landscape, it is clear that Member States have to be supported by more comprehensive, cross-policy \napproach to building cyber resilience.  \n(25)  ENISA should assist the Member States and Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies in their efforts to build \nand enhance capabilities and preparedness to prevent, detect and respond to cyber threats and incidents and in \nrelation to the security of network and information systems. In particular, ENISA should support the development \nand enhancement of national and Union computer security incident response teams (\u2018CSIRTs\u2019) provided for in \nDirective (EU) 2016/1148, with a view to achieving a high common level of their maturity in the Union. Activities \ncarried out by ENISA relating to the operational capacities of Member States should actively support actions taken \nby Member States to comply with their obligations under Directive (EU) 2016/1148 and therefore should not \nsupersede them.  \n(26)  ENISA should also assist with the development and updating of strategies on the security of network and \ninformation systems at Union level and, upon request, at Member State level, in particular on cybersecurity, \nand should promote the dissemination of such strategies and follow the progress of their implementation. \nENISA should also contribute to covering the need for training and training materials, including the needs of \npublic bodies, and where appropriate, to a high extent, \u2018train the trainers\u2019, building on the Digital Competence \nFramework for Citizens with a view to assisting Member States and Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies \nin developing their own training capabilities.  \n(27)  ENISA should support Member States in the field of cybersecurity awareness-raising and education by facilitating \ncloser coordination and the exchange of best practices between Member States. Such support could consist in the \ndevelopment of a network of national education points of contact and the development of a cybersecurity training \nplatform. The network of national education points of contact could operate within the National Liaison Officers \nNetwork and be a starting point for future coordination within the Members States.  \n(28)  ENISA should assist the Cooperation Group created by Directive (EU) 2016/1148 in the execution of its tasks, in \nparticular by providing expertise, advice and by facilitating the exchange of best practices, inter alia, with regard to \nthe identification of operators of essential services by Member States, as well as in relation to cross-border \ndependencies, regarding risks and incidents.  \n(29)  With a view to stimulating cooperation between the public and private sector and within the private sector, in \nparticular to support the protection of the critical infrastructures, ENISA should support information sharing \nwithin and among sectors, in particular the sectors listed in Annex II to Directive (EU) 2016/1148, by \nproviding best practices and guidance on available tools and on procedure, as well as by providing guidance \non how to address regulatory issues related to information sharing, for example through facilitating the estab \u00ad\nlishment of sectoral information sharing and analysis centres.  \n(30)  Whereas the potential negative impact of vulnerabilities in ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes is \nconstantly increasing, finding and remedying such vulnerabilities plays an important role in reducing the overall \ncybersecurity risk.

In \nthat context ENISA should involve the private sector within the framework of Directive (EU) 2016/1148 which \nlays down the grounds for the voluntary exchange of technical information at the operational level, in the \ncomputer security incident response teams network (\u2018CSIRTs network\u2019) created by that Directive.  \n(32)  ENISA should contribute to responses at Union level in the case of large-scale cross-border incidents and crises \nrelated to cybersecurity. That task should be performed in accordance with ENISA\u2019s mandate under this Regulation \nand an approach to be agreed by Member States in the context of Commission Recommendation (EU) \n2017/1584 (  15 ) and the Council conclusions of 26 June 2018 on EU Coordinated Response to Large-Scale \nCybersecurity Incidents and Crises. That task could include gathering relevant information and acting as a \nfacilitator between the CSIRTs network and the technical community, as well as between decision makers \nresponsible for crisis management. Furthermore, ENISA should support operational cooperation among Member \nStates, where requested by one or more Member States, in the handling of incidents from a technical perspective, \nby facilitating relevant exchanges of technical solutions between Member States, and by providing input into public \ncommunications. ENISA should support operational cooperation by testing the arrangements for such cooperation \nthrough regular cybersecurity exercises.  \n(33)  In supporting operational cooperation, ENISA should make use of the available technical and operational expertise \nof CERT-EU through structured cooperation. Such structured cooperation could build on ENISA\u2019s expertise.

ENISA \nshould facilitate the technical handling of incidents having a significant or substantial impact in particular by \nsupporting the voluntary sharing of technical solutions between Member States or by producing combined \ntechnical information, such as technical solutions voluntarily shared by the Member States. Recommendation \n(EU) 2017/1584 recommends that Member States cooperate in good faith and share among themselves and \nwith ENISA information on large-scale incidents and crises related to cybersecurity without undue delay. Such \ninformation would further help ENISA in performing its task of supporting operational cooperation.  \n(35)  As part of the regular cooperation at technical level to support Union situational awareness, ENISA, in close \ncooperation with the Member States, should prepare a regular in-depth EU Cybersecurity Technical Situation \nReport on incidents and cyber threats, based on publicly available information, its own analysis and reports \nshared with it by Member States\u2019 CSIRTs or the national single points of contact on the security of network \nand information systems (\u2018single points of contact\u2019) provided for in Directive (EU) 2016/1148, both on a voluntary \nbasis, the European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) at Europol, CERT-EU and, where appropriate, the European Union \nIntelligence and Situation Centre (EU INTCEN) at the European External Action Service.

their right to protect commercially sensitive information \nand information that is relevant to public security.  \n(38)  To understand better the challenges in the area of cybersecurity, and with a view to providing strategic long-term \nadvice to Member States and Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies, ENISA needs to analyse current and \nemerging cybersecurity risks. For that purpose, ENISA should, in cooperation with Member States and, as appro \u00ad\npriate, with statistical bodies and other bodies, collect relevant publicly available or voluntarily shared information \nand perform analyses of emerging technologies and provide topic-specific assessments on the expected societal, \nlegal, economic and regulatory impact of technological innovations on network and information security, in \nparticular cybersecurity. ENISA should, furthermore, support Member States and Union institutions, bodies, \noffices and agencies in identifying emerging cybersecurity risks and preventing incidents, by performing \nanalyses of cyber threats, vulnerabilities and incidents.  \n(39)  In order to increase the resilience of the Union, ENISA should develop expertise in the field of cybersecurity of \ninfrastructures, in particular to support the sectors listed in Annex II to Directive (EU) 2016/1148 and those used \nby the providers of the digital services listed in Annex III to that Directive, by providing advice, issuing guidelines \nand exchanging best practices. With a view to ensuring easier access to better-structured information on cyberse \u00ad\ncurity risks and possible remedies, ENISA should develop and maintain the \u2018information hub\u2019 of the Union, a one- \nstop-shop portal providing the public with information on cybersecurity originating in Union and national \ninstitutions, bodies, offices and agencies. Facilitating access to better-structured information on cybersecurity \nrisks and possible remedies could also help Member States bolster their capacities and align their practices, thus \nincreasing their overall resilience to cyberattacks.  \n(40)  ENISA should contribute to raising the public\u2019s awareness of cybersecurity risks, including through an EU-wide \nawareness-raising campaign by promoting education, and to providing guidance on good practices for individual \nusers aimed at citizens, organisations and businesses. ENISA should also contribute to promoting best practices \nand solutions, including cyber-hygiene and cyber-literacy at the level of citizens, organisations and businesses by \ncollecting and analysing publicly available information regarding significant incidents, and by compiling and \npublishing reports and guidance for citizens, organisations and businesses, to improve their overall level of \npreparedness and resilience. ENISA should also strive to provide consumers with relevant information on \napplicable certification schemes, for example by providing guidelines and recommendations. ENISA should \nfurthermore organise, in line with the Digital Education Action Plan established in the Commission Communi \u00ad\ncation of 17 January 2018 and in cooperation with the Member States and Union institutions, bodies, offices and \nagencies regular outreach and public education campaigns directed at end users, to promote safer online behaviour \nby individuals and digital literacy, to raise awareness of potential cyber threats, including online criminal activities \nsuch as phishing attacks, botnets, financial and banking fraud, data fraud incidents, and to promote basic multi- \nfactor authentication, patching, encryption, anonymisation and data protection advice.  \n(41)  ENISA should play a central role in accelerating end-user awareness of the security of devices and the secure use of \nservices, and should promote security-by-design and privacy-by-design at Union level.

In order to identify the research needs and priorities, ENISA should also consult the relevant \nuser groups. More specifically, cooperation with the European Research Council, the European Institute for \nInnovation and Technology and the European Union Institute for Security Studies could be established.  \n(53)  ENISA should regularly consult standardisation organisations, in particular European standardisation organisations, \nwhen preparing the European cybersecurity certification schemes.  \n(54)  Cyber threats are a global issue. There is a need for closer international cooperation to improve cybersecurity \nstandards, including the need for definitions of common norms of behaviour, the adoption of codes of conduct, \nthe use of international standards, and information sharing, promoting swifter international collaboration in \nresponse to network and information security issues and promoting a common global approach to such issues. \nTo that end, ENISA should support further Union involvement and cooperation with third countries and inter \u00ad\nnational organisations by providing the necessary expertise and analysis to the relevant Union institutions, bodies, \noffices and agencies, where appropriate.  \n(55)  ENISA should be able to respond to ad hoc requests for advice and assistance by Member States and Union \ninstitutions, bodies, offices and agencies on matters falling within ENISA\u2019s mandate.  \n(56)  It is sensible and recommended to implement certain principles regarding the governance of ENISA in order to \ncomply with the Joint Statement and Common Approach agreed upon in July 2012 by the Inter-Institutional \nWorking Group on EU decentralised agencies, the purpose of which is to streamline the activities of decentralised \nagencies and improve their performance. The recommendations in the Joint Statement and Common Approach \nshould also be reflected, as appropriate, in ENISA\u2019s work programmes, evaluations of ENISA, and ENISA\u2019s \nreporting and administrative practice.  \n(57)  The Management Board, composed of the representatives of the Member States and of the Commission, should \nestablish the general direction of ENISA\u2019s operations and ensure that it carries out its tasks in accordance with this \nRegulation. The Management Board should be entrusted with the powers necessary to establish the budget, verify \nthe execution of the budget, adopt appropriate financial rules, establish transparent working procedures for \ndecision making by ENISA, adopt ENISA\u2019s single programming document, adopt its own rules of procedure, \nappoint the Executive Director and decide on the extension and termination of the Executive Director\u2019s term of \noffice.  \n(58)  In order for ENISA to function properly and effectively, the Commission and the Member States should ensure that \npersons to be appointed to the Management Board have appropriate professional expertise and experience. The \nCommission and the Member States should also make efforts to limit the turnover of their respective represen \u00ad\ntatives on the Management Board in order to ensure continuity in its work.  \n(59)  The smooth functioning of ENISA requires that its Executive Director be appointed on grounds of merit and \ndocumented administrative and managerial skills, as well as competence and experience relevant to cybersecurity. \nThe duties of the Executive Director should be carried out with complete independence. The Executive Director \nshould prepare a proposal for ENISA\u2019s annual work programme, after prior consultation with the Commission, and \nshould take all steps necessary to ensure the proper implementation of that work programme. The Executive \nDirector should prepare an annual report to be submitted to the Management Board, covering the implementation \nof ENISA\u2019s annual work programme, draw up a draft statement of estimates of revenue and expenditure for ENISA, \nand implement the budget.

The supply of ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes within the single \nmarket remains very fragmented geographically. This is because the cybersecurity industry in Europe has developed \nlargely on the basis of national governmental demand. In addition, the lack of interoperable solutions (technical \nstandards), practices and Union-wide mechanisms of certification are among the other gaps affecting the single \nmarket in the field of cybersecurity. This makes it difficult for European businesses to compete at national, Union \nand global level. It also reduces the choice of viable and usable cybersecurity technologies that individuals and \nbusinesses have access to. Similarly, in the 2017 Communication on the Mid-Term Review on the implementation \nof the Digital Single Market Strategy \u2013 A Connected Digital Single Market for All, the Commission highlighted the \nneed for safe connected products and systems, and indicated that the creation of a European ICT security \nframework setting rules on how to organise ICT security certification in the Union could both preserve trust in \nthe internet and tackle the current fragmentation of the internal market.  \n(67)  Currently, the cybersecurity certification of ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes is used only to a limited \nextent. When it exists, it mostly occurs at Member State level or in the framework of industry driven schemes. In \nthat context, a certificate issued by a national cybersecurity certification authority is not in principle recognised in \nother Member States. Companies thus may have to certify their ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes in \nseveral Member States where they operate, for example, with a view to participating in national procurement \nprocedures, which thereby adds to their costs. Moreover, while new schemes are emerging, there seems to be no \ncoherent and holistic approach to horizontal cybersecurity issues, for instance in the field of the IoT. Existing \nschemes present significant shortcomings and differences in terms of product coverage, levels of assurance, \nsubstantive criteria and actual use, impeding mutual recognition mechanisms within the Union.  \n(68)  Some efforts have been made in order to ensure the mutual recognition of certificates within the Union. However, \nthey have been only partly successful. The most important example in this regard is the Senior Officials Group \u2013 \nInformation Systems Security (SOG-IS) Mutual Recognition Agreement (MRA). While it represents the most \nimportant model for cooperation and mutual recognition in the field of security certification, SOG-IS includes \nonly some of the Member States. That fact has limited the effectiveness of SOG-IS MRA from the point of view of \nthe internal market.  \n(69)  Therefore, it is necessary to adopt a common approach and to establish a European cybersecurity certification \nframework that lays down the main horizontal requirements for European cybersecurity certification schemes to be \ndeveloped and allows European cybersecurity certificates and EU statements of conformity for ICT products, ICT \nservices or ICT processes to be recognised and used in all Member States. In doing so, it is essential to build on \nexisting national and international schemes, as well as on mutual recognition systems, in particular SOG-IS, and to \nmake possible a smooth transition from the existing schemes under such systems to schemes under the new \nEuropean cybersecurity certification framework. The European cybersecurity certification framework should have a \ntwofold purpose. First, it should help increase trust in ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes that have been \ncertified under European cybersecurity certification schemes. Second, it should help avoid the multiplication of \nconflicting or overlapping national cybersecurity certification schemes and thus reduce costs for undertakings \noperating in the digital single market. The European cybersecurity certification schemes should be non-discrimi \u00ad\nnatory and based on European or international standards, unless those standards are ineffective or inappropriate to \nfulfil the Union\u2019s legitimate objectives in that regard.  \n(70)  The European cybersecurity certification framework should be established in a uniform manner in all Member \nStates in order to prevent \u2018certification shopping\u2019 based on different levels of stringency in different Member States.  \n(71)  European cybersecurity certification schemes should be built on what already exists at international and national \nlevel and, if necessary, on technical specifications from forums and consortia, learning from current strong points \nand assessing and correcting weaknesses.  \n(72)  Flexible cybersecurity solutions are necessary for the industry to stay ahead of cyber threats, and therefore any \ncertification scheme should be designed in a way that avoids the risk of being outdated quickly.EN  7.6.2019 Official Journal of the European Union L 151/25", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 5262, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7faafbea-546b-4016-9c50-9836537556b7": {"__data__": {"id_": "7faafbea-546b-4016-9c50-9836537556b7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "CELEX_32019R0881_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\User\\Box\\UTD\\PhD Research\\RAG-app\\Current Cybersecurity Law\\International\\International\\Cybersecurity Act\\CELEX_32019R0881_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 885350, "creation_date": "2024-06-05", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "dc15f1ed-e1fe-49bc-a645-cfa2478bf4fb", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "CELEX_32019R0881_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\User\\Box\\UTD\\PhD Research\\RAG-app\\Current Cybersecurity Law\\International\\International\\Cybersecurity Act\\CELEX_32019R0881_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 885350, "creation_date": "2024-06-05", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-03"}, "hash": "af1463a42b479a2bd4b7cd77535d25479b9f3b8a91330b48fca4dfb3a793d86b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9e583afe-b75c-4c10-94b8-c652135129d3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "CELEX_32019R0881_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\User\\Box\\UTD\\PhD Research\\RAG-app\\Current Cybersecurity Law\\International\\International\\Cybersecurity Act\\CELEX_32019R0881_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 885350, "creation_date": "2024-06-05", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-03"}, "hash": "720f39c80a3a5de5cd72b73a374ea090928fbfba057e67d6cb3feda65e035556", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "39818e08-fee4-479a-80da-6f2d4dc4c6d9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5b9e55a82ecaf5a59e4ac176d9cd335c4e41fdd6335a85b045b9f536be9c64e2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "(73)  The Commission should be empowered to adopt European cybersecurity certification schemes concerning specific \ngroups of ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes. Those schemes should be implemented and supervised by \nnational cybersecurity certification authorities, and certificates issued under those schemes should be valid and \nrecognised throughout the Union. Certification schemes operated by the industry or by other private organisations \nshould fall outside of the scope of this Regulation. However, the bodies operating such schemes should be able to \npropose that the Commission consider such schemes as a basis for approving them as a European cybersecurity \ncertification scheme.  \n(74)  The provisions of this Regulation should be without prejudice to Union law providing specific rules on the \ncertification of ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes. In particular, Regulation (EU) 2016/679 lays \ndown provisions for the establishment of certification mechanisms and of data protection seals and marks, for \nthe purpose of demonstrating the compliance of processing operations by controllers and processors with that \nRegulation. Such certification mechanisms and data protection seals and marks should allow data subjects to \nquickly assess the level of data protection of the relevant ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes. This \nRegulation is without prejudice to the certification of data processing operations under Regulation (EU) 2016/679, \nincluding when such operations are embedded in ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes.  \n(75)  The purpose of European cybersecurity certification schemes should be to ensure that ICT products, ICT services \nand ICT processes certified under such schemes comply with specified requirements that aim to protect the \navailability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality of stored, transmitted or processed data or of the related \nfunctions of or services offered by, or accessible via those products, services and processes throughout their life \ncycle. It is not possible to set out in detail the cybersecurity requirements relating to all ICT products, ICT services \nand ICT processes in this Regulation. ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes and the cybersecurity needs \nrelated to those products, services and processes are so diverse that it is very difficult to develop general cyberse \u00ad\ncurity requirements that are valid in all circumstances. It is therefore necessary to adopt a broad and general notion \nof cybersecurity for the purpose of certification, which should be complemented by a set of specific cybersecurity \nobjectives that are to be taken into account when designing European cybersecurity certification schemes. The \narrangements by which such objectives are to be achieved in specific ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes \nshould then be further specified in detail at the level of the individual certification scheme adopted by the \nCommission, for example by reference to standards or technical specifications if no appropriate standards are \navailable.  \n(76)  The technical specifications to be used in European cybersecurity certification schemes should respect the \nrequirements set out in Annex II to Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 of the European Parliament and of the \nCouncil (  19 ). Some deviations from those requirements could, however, be considered to be necessary in duly \njustified cases where those technical specifications are to be used in a European cybersecurity certification scheme \nreferring to assurance level \u2018high\u2019. The reasons for such deviations should be made publicly available.  \n(77)  A conformity assessment is a procedure for evaluating whether specified requirements relating to an ICT product, \nICT service or ICT process have been fulfilled. That procedure is carried out by an independent third party that is \nnot the manufacturer or provider of the ICT products, ICT services or ICT processes that are being assessed. A \nEuropean cybersecurity certificate should be issued following the successful evaluation of an ICT product, ICT \nservice or ICT process. A European cybersecurity certificate should be considered to be a confirmation that the \nevaluation has been properly carried out.

In such cases, it should be sufficient that the manufacturer or provider of ICT products, ICT \nservices or ICT processes itself carry out all of the checks to ensure that the ICT products, ICT services or ICT \nprocesses conform with the European cybersecurity certification scheme. Conformity self-assessment should be \nconsidered to be appropriate for low complexity ICT products, ICT services or ICT processes that present a low \nrisk to the public, such as simple design and production mechanisms. Moreover, conformity self-assessment should \nbe permitted for ICT products, ICT services or ICT processes only where they correspond to assurance level \u2018basic\u2019.  \n(80)  European cybersecurity certification schemes could allow for both conformity self-assessments and certifications of \nICT products, ICT services or ICT processes. In such a case, the scheme should provide for clear and under \u00ad\nstandable means for consumers or other users to differentiate between ICT products, ICT services or ICT processes \nwith regard to which the manufacturer or provider of ICT products, ICT services or ICT processes is responsible for \nthe assessment, and ICT products, ICT services or ICT processes that are certified by a third party.  \n(81)  The manufacturer or provider of ICT products, ICT services or ICT processes who carry out a conformity self- \nassessment should be able to issue and sign the EU statement of conformity as part of the conformity assessment \nprocedure. An EU statement of conformity is a document that states that a specific ICT product, ICT service or ICT \nprocess complies with the requirements of the European cybersecurity certification scheme. By issuing and signing \nthe EU statement of conformity, the manufacturer or provider of ICT products, ICT services or ICT processes \nassumes responsibility for the compliance of the ICT product, ICT service or ICT process with the legal \nrequirements of the European cybersecurity certification scheme. A copy of the EU statement of conformity \nshould be submitted to the national cybersecurity certification authority and to ENISA.  \n(82)  Manufacturers or providers of ICT products, ICT services or ICT processes should make the EU statement of \nconformity, technical documentation, and all other relevant information relating to the conformity of the ICT \nproducts, ICT services or ICT processes with a European cybersecurity certification scheme available to the \ncompetent national cybersecurity certification authority for a period provided for in the relevant European \ncybersecurity certification scheme. The technical documentation should specify the requirements applicable \nunder the scheme and should cover the design, manufacture and operation of the ICT product, ICT service or \nICT process to the extent relevant to the conformity self-assessment. The technical documentation should be so \ncompiled as to enable the assessment of whether an ICT product or ICT service complies with the requirements \napplicable under that scheme.  \n(83)  The governance of the European cybersecurity certification framework takes into account the involvement of \nMember States as well as the appropriate involvement of stakeholders, and establishes the role of the Commission \nduring the planning and proposing, requesting, preparing, adopting and reviewing of European cybersecurity \ncertification schemes.  \n(84)  The Commission should prepare, with the support of the European Cybersecurity Certification Group (the \u2018ECCG\u2019) \nand the Stakeholder Cybersecurity Certification Group and after an open and wide consultation, a Union rolling \nwork programme for European cybersecurity certification schemes and should publish it in the form of a non- \nbinding instrument. The Union rolling work programme should be a strategic document that allows industry, \nnational authorities and standardisation bodies, in particular, to prepare in advance for future European cyberse \u00ad\ncurity certification schemes. The Union rolling work programme should include a multiannual overview of the \nrequests for candidate schemes which the Commission intends to submit to ENISA for preparation on the basis of \nspecific grounds. The Commission should take into account the Union rolling work programme while preparing its \nRolling Plan for ICT Standardisation and standardisation requests to European standardisation organisations. In \nlight of the rapid introduction and uptake of new technologies, the emergence of previously unknown cyberse \u00ad\ncurity risks, and legislative and market developments, the Commission or the ECCG should be entitled to request \nENISA to prepare candidate schemes which have not been included in the Union rolling work programme. In such \ncases, the Commission and the ECCG should also assess the necessity of such a request, taking into account the \noverall aims and objectives of this Regulation and the need to ensure continuity as regards ENISA\u2019s planning and \nuse of resources.EN  7.6.2019 Official Journal of the European Union L 151/27", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 5274, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "19bdbc94-628c-4307-b3cb-9ba1688b6f46": {"__data__": {"id_": "19bdbc94-628c-4307-b3cb-9ba1688b6f46", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "CELEX_32019R0881_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\User\\Box\\UTD\\PhD Research\\RAG-app\\Current Cybersecurity Law\\International\\International\\Cybersecurity Act\\CELEX_32019R0881_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 885350, "creation_date": "2024-06-05", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "730b3013-cd60-4ec1-bd81-e474be5106ba", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "CELEX_32019R0881_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\User\\Box\\UTD\\PhD Research\\RAG-app\\Current Cybersecurity Law\\International\\International\\Cybersecurity Act\\CELEX_32019R0881_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 885350, "creation_date": "2024-06-05", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-03"}, "hash": "cb03a2d2b0de522aa093c31798c08f85bf850642525445eb95bfac59061da7a8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6d215731-a57b-43c2-b8c3-661f237ba279", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "CELEX_32019R0881_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\User\\Box\\UTD\\PhD Research\\RAG-app\\Current Cybersecurity Law\\International\\International\\Cybersecurity Act\\CELEX_32019R0881_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 885350, "creation_date": "2024-06-05", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-03"}, "hash": "1b4819e9e9c75b316db9ef94652d2db4bbf4ef65164744f288747edc14364250", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3d56a0eb-b2c7-4231-909d-6586facc5a5c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d84c78580209680f8d5db5cb8cff0e792190d232d5306d8b37508c3004511ecd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Following such a request, ENISA should prepare the candidate schemes for specific ICT products, ICT services and \nICT processes without undue delay. The Commission should evaluate the positive and negative impact of its \nrequest on the specific market in question, especially its impact on SMEs, on innovation, on barriers to entry to \nthat market and on costs to end users. The Commission, on the basis of the candidate scheme prepared by ENISA, \nshould be empowered to adopt the European cybersecurity certification scheme by means of implementing acts. \nTaking account of the general purpose and security objectives laid down in this Regulation, European cybersecurity \ncertification schemes adopted by the Commission should specify a minimum set of elements concerning the \nsubject matter, scope and functioning of the individual scheme. Those elements should include, among other \nthings, the scope and object of the cybersecurity certification, including the categories of ICT products, ICT services \nand ICT processes covered, the detailed specification of the cybersecurity requirements, for example by reference to \nstandards or technical specifications, the specific evaluation criteria and evaluation methods, as well as the intended \nassurance level (\u2018basic\u2019, \u2018substantial\u2019 or \u2018high\u2019) and the evaluation levels where applicable. ENISA should be able to \nrefuse a request by the ECCG. Such decisions should be taken by the Management Board and should be duly \nreasoned.  \n(85)  ENISA should maintain a website providing information on and publicising European cybersecurity certification \nschemes, which should include, among other things, the requests for the preparation of a candidate scheme as well \nas the feedback received in the consultation process carried out by ENISA in the preparation phase. The website \nshould also provide information about the European cybersecurity certificates and EU statements of conformity \nissued under this Regulation including information regarding the withdrawal and expiry of such European cyberse \u00ad\ncurity certificates and EU statements of conformity. The website should also indicate the national cybersecurity \ncertification schemes that have been replaced by a European cybersecurity certification scheme.  \n(86)  The assurance level of a European certification scheme is a basis for confidence that an ICT product, ICT service or \nICT process meets the security requirements of a specific European cybersecurity certification scheme. In order to \nensure the consistency of the European cybersecurity certification framework, a European cybersecurity certification \nscheme should be able to specify assurance levels for European cybersecurity certificates and EU statements of \nconformity issued under that scheme.

The assurance levels would provide the corresponding rigour and depth of the evaluation of the ICT \nproduct, ICT service or ICT process and would be characterised by reference to technical specifications, \nstandards and procedures related thereto, including technical controls, the purpose of which is to mitigate or \nprevent incidents. Each assurance level should be consistent among the different sectorial domains where certifi \u00ad\ncation is applied.  \n(87)  A European cybersecurity certification scheme might specify several evaluation levels depending on the rigour and \ndepth of the evaluation methodology used. Evaluation levels should correspond to one of the assurance levels and \nshould be associated with an appropriate combination of assurance components. For all assurance levels, the ICT \nproduct, ICT service or ICT process should contain a number of secure functions, as specified by the scheme, \nwhich may include: a secure out-of-the-box configuration, a signed code, secure update and exploit mitigations and \nfull stack or heap memory protections. Those functions should have been developed, and be maintained, using \nsecurity-focused development approaches and associated tools to ensure that effective software and hardware \nmechanisms are reliably incorporated.  \n(88)  For assurance level \u2018basic\u2019, the evaluation should be guided at least by the following assurance components: the \nevaluation should at least include a review of the technical documentation of the ICT product, ICT service or ICT \nprocess by the conformity assessment body.

Therefore, ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes that have been certified or for which an EU \nstatement of conformity has been issued should be accompanied by structured information that is adapted to the \nexpected technical level of the intended end user. All such information should be available online, and, where \nappropriate, in physical form.

In addition, the end user should be informed of the cybersecurity support policy, \nnamely for how long the end user can expect to receive cybersecurity updates or patches, of the manufacturer or \nprovider of ICT products, ICT services or ICT processes. Where applicable, guidance on actions or settings that the \nend user can implement to maintain or increase the cybersecurity of the ICT product or of the ICT service and \ncontact information of a single point of contact to report and receive support in the case of cyberattacks (in \naddition to automatic reporting) should be provided.

European cybersecurity certification schemes should specify the conditions under which an \nupdate may require that an ICT product, ICT service or ICT process be recertified or that the scope of a \nspecific European cybersecurity certificate be reduced, taking into account any possible adverse effects of the \nupdate on compliance with the security requirements of that certificate.  \n(97)  Once a European cybersecurity certification scheme is adopted, manufacturers or providers of ICT products, ICT \nservices or ICT processes should be able to submit applications for certification of their ICT products or ICT \nservices to the conformity assessment body of their choice anywhere in the Union. Conformity assessment bodies \nshould be accredited by a national accreditation body if they comply with certain specified requirements set out in \nthis Regulation. Accreditation should be issued for a maximum of five years and should be renewable on the same \nconditions provided that the conformity assessment body still meets the requirements. National accreditation \nbodies should restrict, suspend or revoke the accreditation of a conformity assessment body where the conditions \nfor the accreditation have not been met or are no longer met, or where the conformity assessment body infringes \nthis Regulation.  \n(98)  References in national legislation to national standards which have ceased to be effective due to the entry into \nforce of a European cybersecurity certification scheme can be a source of confusion. Therefore, Member States \nshould reflect the adoption of a European cybersecurity certification scheme in their national legislation.  \n(99)  In order to achieve equivalent standards throughout the Union, to facilitate mutual recognition and to promote the \noverall acceptance of European cybersecurity certificates and EU statements of conformity, it is necessary to put in \nplace a system of peer review between national cybersecurity certification authorities. Peer review should cover \nprocedures for supervising the compliance of ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes with European \ncybersecurity certificates, for monitoring the obligations of manufacturers or providers of ICT products, ICT \nservices or ICT processes who carry out the conformity self-assessment, for monitoring conformity assessment \nbodies, as well as the appropriateness of the expertise of the staff of bodies issuing certificates for assurance level \n\u2018high\u2019. The Commission should be able, by means of implementing acts, to establish at least a five-year plan for \npeer reviews, as well as lay down criteria and methodologies for the operation of the peer review system.  \n(100)  Without prejudice to the general peer review system to be put in place across all national cybersecurity certification \nauthorities within the European cybersecurity certification framework, certain European cybersecurity certification \nschemes may include a peer-assessment mechanism for the bodies that issue European cybersecurity certificates for \nICT products, ICT services and ICT processes with an assurance level \u2018high\u2019 under such schemes. The ECCG should \nsupport the implementation of such peer-assessment mechanisms. The peer assessments should assess in particular \nwhether the bodies concerned carry out their tasks in a harmonised way, and may include appeal mechanisms. The \nresults of the peer assessments should be made publicly available. The bodies concerned may adopt appropriate \nmeasures to adapt their practices and expertise accordingly.  \n(101)  Member States should designate one or more national cybersecurity certification authorities to supervise \ncompliance with obligations arising from this Regulation.

Within the banking union, the application and the super vision of those \nrequirements are ensured by the sing le super visor y mecha nism. For Member State s that are not part of the \nbanking union, this is ensured by the relevant banking regulator s of Member State s. In other areas of financia l \nsector regulation, the European System of Financial Super vision also ensures a high degree of commonality and \nconver gence in super visor y practices. The European Secur ities Marke ts Auth ority also plays a direct super vision \nrole for certain entities, namely credit-rating agencies and trade repositori es. \n(13)  Operational risk is a crucial part of prudential regulation and super vision in the sectors of banking and financial \nmark et infrastr uctures. It covers all operations including the secur ity, integr ity and resilience of network and \ninformation systems.

In order to ensure a consistent approach, the definition of operat or of essential services \nshould be coherently applied by all Member States. To that end, this Directive provides for the assessment of the \nentities active in specifi c sectors and subsect ors, the establishment of a list of essential services, the consideration \nof a common list of cross-sect oral factors to determi ne whether a poten tial incident would have a signif icant \ndisrupti ve effect, a consultation process involving relevant Member States in the case of entities providing services \nin more than one Member State, and the suppor t of the Cooperation Group in the identif ication process. In order \nto ensure that possible changes in the mark et are accurate ly reflecte d, the list of identif ied operat ors should be \nreviewed regularly by Member States and update d when necessar y. Finally , Member States should submit to the \nCommission the information necessar y to assess the exte nt to which this common methodology has allowed \na consistent application of the definit ion by Member State s. \n(20)  In the process of identif ication of operators of essential services, Member States should assess, at least for each \nsubsect or refer red to in this Directive, which services have to be considered as essential for the maint enance of \ncritical societal and economic activities, and whether the entities liste d in the sectors and subsect ors refer red to in \nthis Directive and providing those services meet the criteria for the identif ication of operators. When assessing \nwhether an entity provides a service which is essential for the maintenance of critical societal or economic \nactivities, it is suffi cient to examine whether that entity provides a service that is included in the list of essential \nservices. Further more, it should be demonstrated that provision of the essential service is dependent on netw ork \nand information syste ms. Finally , when assessing whether an incident would have a signif icant disruptive effect \non the provision of the service, Member State s should take into account a number of cross-sectoral factors, as \nwell as, where appropr iate, sector-specific factors. \n(21)  For the purposes of identifying operators of essential services, establishment in a Member State implies the \neffective and real exer cise of activity through stable arrange ments.

The Member States concer ned should take into account each other's views in this process, and \nshould be able to request the assistance of the Cooperation Group in this regard. \n(25)  As a result of the identif ication process, Member States should adopt national measures to determine which \nentities are subject to oblig ations regarding the secur ity of netw ork and information systems. This result could be \nachi eved by adop ting a list enumerating all operators of essential services or by adoptin g national measures \nincluding objective quantifiable criteria, such as the output of the operator or the number of users, which make it \npossible to determine whic h entities are subject to oblig ations regarding the secur ity of netw ork and information \nsystem s.

As some digital \nservices could be an impor tant resource for their users, including operat ors of essential services, and as such \nusers might not alwa ys have altern atives available, this Directive should also apply to providers of such services. \nThe secur ity, continuity and reliability of the type of digital services referred to in this Directive are of the essence \nfor the smooth functioning of man y businesses. A disruption of such a digital service could prevent the provision \nof other services which rely on it and could thus have an impact on key economic and societal activities in the \nUnion. Such digital services might theref ore be of crucial impor tance for the smooth functioning of businesses \nthat depend on them and, moreo ver, for the participation of such businesses in the internal mark et and cross- \nborder trade across the Union. Those digital service providers that are subject to this Directive are those that are \nconsidered to offer digital services on whic h man y businesses in the Union increasing ly rely. \n(49)  Digital service providers should ensure a level of secur ity commensurat e with the degree of risk posed to the \nsecur ity of the digital services they provide, given the importance of their services to the operations of other \nbusinesses within the Union. In practice, the degree of risk for operat ors of essential services, which are often \nessential for the maint enance of critical societal and economic activities, is higher than for digital service \nproviders. Theref ore, the secur ity requirements for digital service providers should be lighter . Digital service \nproviders should remain free to take measures they consider appropr iate to manag e the risks posed to the \nsecur ity of their network and information syste ms. Because of their cross-border nature, digital service providers \nshould be subject to a more harmonised approach at Union level. Implementing acts should facilitate the specifi \u00ad\ncation and imple mentation of such measures. \n(50)  While hardware manufacturers and software developers are not operat ors of essential services, nor are they \ndigital service providers, their products enhance the secur ity of netw ork and information system s.

By reporting breaches of Union law that are harmful to the public interest, such \npersons act as \u2018whistleblowers \u2019 and thereby play a  key role in exposing and preventing such breaches and in \nsaf\neguarding the welfare of society. However, potential whistleblowers are often discouraged from reporting \ntheir concerns or suspicions for fear of retaliation. In this context, the importance of providing balanced and \neffective whistleblower protection is increasingly acknowledged at both Union and international level.\n(2) At U nion level, reports and public disclosures by whistleblowers are one upstream component of enforcement \nof\n Union law and policies. They feed national and Union enforcement systems with information, leading to \neffective detection, investigation and prosecution of breaches of Union law, thus enhancing transparency and \naccountability.\n(3) In certain policy areas, breaches of Union law, regardless of whether they are categorised under national law as \nadminis tr\native, criminal or other types of breaches, may cause serious harm to the public interest, in that they \ncreate significant risks for the welfare of society. Where weaknesses of enforcement have been identified in \nthose areas, and whistleblowers are usually in a privileged position to  disclose breaches, it is necessary to \nenhance enforcement by introducing effective, confidential and secure reporting channels and by ensuring that \nwhistleblowers are protected effectively against retaliation.\n(4) Whistleblower pr o tection currently provided in the Union is fragmented across Member States and uneven \nacross policy areas. The consequences of breaches of Union law with a cross-b or der dimension report ed by \nwhistleblowers illustrate how insufficient protection in one Member State negatively impacts the functioning of \nUnion policies not only in that Member State, but also in other Member States and in the Union as a whole.\n(5) Common minimum st andar ds ensuring that whistleblowers are protected effectively should apply as regards \nacts and policy areas where there is a need to strengthen enforcement, under-reporting by whistleblowers is \na\n key factor affecting enforcement, and breaches of Union law can cause serious harm to the public interest. \nMember\n States could decide to extend the application of national provisions to other areas with a view to \nensur\ning that there is a comprehensive and coherent whistleblower protection framework at national level.\n(1)OJ C 405,  9.11.2018,  p. 1.\n(2)OJ C 62,  15.2.2019,  p. 155 .\n(3)Position  of  the  European  Parliament  of  16  April  2019  (not  yet  published  in  the  Official  Journal)  and  decision  of  the  Council  of \n7 October  2019 .26.11.2019 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 305/17", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4184, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f3041718-8204-4f30-8a3a-2dfdb3209631": {"__data__": {"id_": "f3041718-8204-4f30-8a3a-2dfdb3209631", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "CELEX_32019L1937_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\User\\Box\\UTD\\PhD Research\\RAG-app\\Current Cybersecurity Law\\International\\International\\EU Directives\\Directive EU 2019-1937\\CELEX_32019L1937_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1461688, "creation_date": "2024-06-05", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2d689061-6782-479b-a59a-9d3f2a611269", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "CELEX_32019L1937_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\User\\Box\\UTD\\PhD Research\\RAG-app\\Current Cybersecurity Law\\International\\International\\EU Directives\\Directive EU 2019-1937\\CELEX_32019L1937_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1461688, "creation_date": "2024-06-05", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-03"}, "hash": "890b2e3eb10939e106e66b686a0aa09665eb936c05d5ba2567e63c16af5e1f33", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "858682a2-6001-4c38-8aac-20b3ca199155", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "CELEX_32019L1937_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\User\\Box\\UTD\\PhD Research\\RAG-app\\Current Cybersecurity Law\\International\\International\\EU Directives\\Directive EU 2019-1937\\CELEX_32019L1937_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1461688, "creation_date": "2024-06-05", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-03"}, "hash": "405abd83a00c649bc2558c1eff35504db5235cf5a1dbb314da803f75a48a9c5c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e462a387-8654-4a74-8d64-d803fa980016", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "156333e52642c4ae28e70373134fe35b0abae7b41a800c1fb6c26be0a2b28947", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "(6) Whistleblower pr o tection is necessary to enhance the enforcement of Union law on public procurement. It is \nnecessary, not only to prevent and detect procurement-related fraud and corruption in the context of the imple\u00ad\nmentation of the Union budget, but also to tackle insufficient enforcement of rules on public procurement by \nnational contracting authorities and contracting entities in relation to the execution of works, the supply of \nproducts or the provision of services. Breaches of such rules create distortions of competition, increase costs for \ndoing business, undermine the interests of investors and shareholders and, in general, lower attractiveness for \ninvestment and create an uneven playing field for all businesses across the Union, thus affecting the proper \nfunctioning of the internal market.\n(7) In the area of financial services, the added value of whistleblower protection has already been acknowledged by the \nUnion legislator. In the aftermath of the financial crisis, which exposed serious shortcomings in the enforcement of \nthe rele vant rules, measures for the protection of whistleblowers, including internal and external reporting chan\u00ad\nnels,\n as well as an explicit prohibition of retaliation, were introduced in a  significant number of legislative  acts in \nthe area of financial services as indicated by the Commission in its communication of 8  December  2010  entitled \n\u2018Reinforcing sanctioning regimes  in the financial services sector \u2019. In particular, in the context of the prudential \nfr\namework applicable to  credit institutions and investment firms, Directive 2013/36/EU  of the European Parlia\u00ad\nment\n and of the  Council  (4) pr ovides for whistleblower protection which applies in the context of Regulation (EU) \nN\no 575 /2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council  (5).\n(8) As r egards the safety of products placed on the internal market, businesses involved in the manufacturing and \ndistr\nibution chain are the primary source of evidence, with the result that reporting by whistleblowers in such \nbusinesses has a high added v alue, since they are much closer to information about possible unfair and illicit \nmanuf\nacturing, import or distribution practices regarding unsafe products. Accordingly, there is a need to intro\u00ad\nduce whistleblo\nwer protection in relation to the safety requirements applicable to products regulated by the \nUnion harmonisation legislation as set out in Annexes I and II to Regulation (EU) 2019/1020  of the European \nP\narliament and of the Council  (6), and in relation to the general product safety requirements as set out in \nDirectiv\ne 2001 /95/EC  of the European Parliament and of the Council  (7). Whis tleblower protection as provided \nf\nor in this Directive would also be instrumental in avoiding diversion of firearms, their parts and components \nand ammunition, as well as of defence-related products, since it would encourage the reporting of breaches of \nUnion law, such as document fraud, altered marking and fraudulent acquisition of firearms within the Union \nwhere breaches often imply a diversion from the legal to the illegal market. Whistleblower protection as pro\u00ad\nvided\n for in this Directive would also help prevent the illicit manufacture of homemade explosives by contribut\u00ad\ning to the correct application of restrictions and controls regarding explosives precursors.\n(9) The im portance of whistleblower protection in terms of preventing and deterring breaches of Union rules on \ntr\nansport safety, which can endanger human lives, has already been acknowledged in sectorial Union acts on \naviation safety, namely in Regulation (EU) No 376/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council  (8), and \nmar itime\n transport safety, namely in Directives 2013/54/EU  (9) and 2009/16/EC  (10) of the European Parliament \nand of t he\n Council, which provide for tailored measures of protection for

Those acts also provide for the protection of workers who report their own honest mistakes \nagainst\n retaliation, so-called \u2018just culture \u2019. It is necessary  to complement the existing elements of whistleblower \nprotection in those two sectors, as well as to provide protection in other transport modes, namely inland water\u00ad\nway, road and railway transport, to enhance the enforcement of safety standards as regards those transport \nmodes.\n(10) As r egards the area of protection of the environment, evidence-gathering, preventing, detecting and addressing \nen\nvironmental crimes and unlawful conduct remain a challenge and actions in that  regard need to be rein\u00ad\nforced, as acknowledged by the Commission in its communication of 18 January  2018  entitled \u2018EU actions to \nim\nprove environmental compliance and governance \u2019. Given that before the entry into force of this Directive, the \nonly\n existing whistleblower protection rules related to environmental protection are provided for in one secto\u00ad\nrial act, namely Directive 2013 /30/EU  of the European Parliament and of the Council  (11), the introduction of \nsuc\nh protection is necessary to ensure effective enforcement of the Union environmental acquis , the breaches of \nwhich\n can cause harm to the public interest with possible spillover impacts across national borders. The intro\u00ad\nduction of such protection is also relevant in cases where unsafe products can cause environmental harm.\n(11) Enhancing whis tleblo wer protection would also contribute to preventing and deterring breaches of European \nAtomic Energy Community rules on nuclear safety, radiation protection and responsible and safe management \nof spent fuel and radioactive waste. It would also strengthen the enforcement of the relevant provisions of \nCouncil Directive 2009 /71/Euratom  (12), concerning promotion and enhancement of an effective nuclear safety \nculture\n and, in particular, point (a) of Article 8b(2)  of that Directive, which requires, inter alia, that the compe\u00ad\ntent\n regulatory authority establishes management systems which give due priority to nuclear safety and pro\u00ad\nmote, at all levels of staff and management, the ability to question the effective delivery of relevant safety prin\u00ad\nciples and practices and to report in a timely manner on safety issues.\n(12) The intr oduction of a  whistleblower pro tection framework would also contribute to strengthening the enforce\u00ad\nment of existing provisions, and to preventing breaches of Union rules, in the area of the food chain and, in \nparticular, on food and feed safety, as well as on animal health, protection and welfare. The different Union \nrules laid down in those areas are closely interlinked. Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament \nand of the\n Council  (13) sets out the general principles and requirements which underpin all Union and national \nmeasures\n relating to food and feed, with a particular focus on food safety, in order to ensure a  high level of \npr\notection of human health and consumers' interests in relation to food, as well as the effective functioning of \nthe internal market. That Regulation provides, inter alia, that food and feed business operators are prevented \nfrom discouraging their employees and others from cooperating with competent authorities where such coop\u00ad\neration could prevent, reduce or eliminate a risk ar ising from food. The Union legislator has taken a  similar \napproac\nh in the area of animal health through Regulation (EU) 2016/429  of t he European Parliament and of \nt\nhe Council  (14) establishing the rules for the prevention and control of animal diseases which are transmissible \nt\no animals or to humans and in the area of the protection and well-being of animals kept for farming purposes, \nof

preventing, reducing or eliminating \nr\nisks to public health and to consumer protection resulting from breaches of Union rules, which might other\u00ad\nwise remain hidden. In particular, consumer protection is also strongly linked to cases where unsafe products \ncan cause considerable harm to consumers.\n(14) Respect f or privacy and protection of personal data, which are enshrined as fundamental rights in Ar ticles 7 \nand 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the \u2018 Charter \u2019), are other areas in which \nwhis\ntleblowers can help to disclose breaches, which can harm the public interest. Whistleblowers can also help \ndisclose breaches of Directive (EU) 2016/1148  of the European Parliament and of the Council  (19) on t he secu\u00ad\nr\nity of network and information systems, which introduces a requirement to  provide notification of incidents, \nincluding those that do not compromise personal data, and security requirements for entities providing essen\u00ad\ntial services across many sectors, for example energy, health, transport and banking, for providers of key digital \nservices, for example cloud computing services, and for suppliers of basic utilities, such as water, electricity and \ngas. Whistleblowers' reporting in this area is particularly valuable for the prevention of security incidents that \nwould affect key economic and social activities and widely used digital services, as well as for the prevention of \nany infringement of Union data protection rules. Such reporting helps ensure the continuity of services that are \nessential for the functioning of the internal market and the wellbeing of society.\n(15) Furthermore, t he  protection of the financial interests of the Union, which is related to the fight against fraud, \ncorruption and any other illegal activity affecting Union expenditure, the collection of Union revenues and \nfunds or Union assets, is a core area in which enforcement of Union law needs to be strengthened. The \ns\ntrengthening of the protection of the financial interests of the Union is relevant also for the implementation of \nthe Union budget as regards expenditure that is incurred on the basis of the Treaty establishing the European \nAtomic Energy Community (Euratom Treaty). Lack of effective enforcement in the area of protection of the \nfinancial interests of the Union, including as regards prevention of fraud and corruption at national level, leads \nto a decrease of Union  revenues and a misuse of Union funds, which can distort public investments, hinder \ng\nrowth and undermine citizens' trust in Union action. Article 325  of the Treaty on the Functioning of the \nEur\nopean Union (TFEU) requires the Union and the Member States to counter fraud and any other illegal activi\u00ad\nties affecting the financial interests of the Union. Relevant Union measures in this respect include, in particular, \nCouncil Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2988 /95 (20) and Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013 of the European \nPar\nliament and of the Council  (21). Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2988 /95 is complemented, for the most serious \ntypes  \nof fraud-related conduct, by Directive (EU) 2017/1371  of the European Parliament and of the Council  (22) \nand b y the Convention drawn up on the basis of Ar ticle K.3  of the Treaty on European Union, on the protec\u00ad\ntion\n of the European Communities' financial interests of 26 July  1995  (23), including t he Protocols thereto of \n27\n September  1996  (24), of 29  November  1996  (25) and of 19 June  1997  (26).

Such reports are made pursuant to specific procedures that aim to guarantee the anonymity of such per\u00ad\nsons in order to protect their physical integrity, and that are distinct from the reporting channels provided for \nunder this Directive.\n(31) Persons who r eport information about threats or harm to the public interest obtained in the context of their \nwork-related activities make use of their right to freedom of expression. The right to freedom of expression and \ninformation, enshrined in Article 11  of t he Charter and in Article 10  of t he Convention for the Protection of \nHuman Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, encompasses the right to receive and impart information as well as \nthe freedom and pluralism of the media. Accordingly, this Directive draws upon the case law of the European \nCourt of Human Rights (ECHR) on the right to freedom of expression, and the principles developed on this \nbasis by the Council of Europe in its Recommendation on the Protection of Whistleblowers adopted by its \nCommittee of Ministers on 30 April  2014 .\n(32) To enjo y protection under this Directive, reporting persons should have reasonable grounds to believe, in light \nof the circumstances and the information available to them at the time of reporting, that the matters reported \nby them are true. That requirement is an essential safeguard against malicious and frivolous or abusive reports \nas it ensures that those who, at the time of the reporting, deliberately and knowingly reported wrong or mis\u00ad\nleading information do not enjoy protection. At the same time, the requirement ensures that protection is not \nlost where the reporting person reported inaccurate information on breaches by honest mistake. Similarly, \nreporting persons should be entitled to protection under this Directive if they have reasonable grounds to \nbelieve that the information reported falls within its scope. The motives of the reporting persons in reporting \nshould be irrelevant in deciding whether they should receive protection.\n(33) Reporting persons normally feel more at ease reporting internally, unless they have reasons to report externally. \nEm\npirical studies show that the majority of whistleblowers tend to report internally, within the organisation in \nwhich they work. Internal reporting is also the best way to get information to the persons who can contribute \nto the early and effective resolution of risks to the public interest. At the same time, the reporting person \nshould be able to choose the most appropriate reporting channel depending on the individual circumstances of \nthe case. Moreover, it is necessary to protect public disclosures, taking into account democratic principles such \nas transparency and accountability, and fundamental rights such as freedom of expression and the freedom and \npluralism of the media, whilst balancing the interest of employers to manage their organisations and to protect \ntheir interests, on the one hand, with the interest of the public to be protected from harm, on the other, in line \nwith the criteria developed in the case law of the ECHR.\n(34) Without prejudice to existing obligations to provide for anonymous reporting by virtue of Union law, it should \nbe possible f\nor Member States to decide whether legal entities in the private and public sector and competent \nauthorities are required to accept and follow up on anonymous reports of breaches which fall within the scope \nof this Directive. However, persons who anonymously reported or who made anonymous public disclosures \nfalling within the scope of this Directive and meet its conditions should enjoy protection under this Directive if \nthey are subsequently identified and suffer retaliation.\n(35) This Dir ective should provide for protection to be granted in cases where persons report, pursuant to Union \nlegislation, to institutions, bodies, offices or agencies of the Union, for example in the context of fraud concern\u00ad\ning the Union budget.\n(36) Persons need specif ic legal protection where they acquire the information they report through their work-\nrelated activities and therefore run the risk of work-related retaliation, for instance, for breaching the duty of \nconfidentiality or loyalty. The underlying reason for providing such persons with protection is their position of \neconomic vulnerability vis-\u00e0-vis the person on whom de f acto  t hey depend for work.

Protection should, thus, \nalso be granted to workers in non-standard employment relationships, including part-time workers and fixed-\nterm contract workers, as well as persons with a contract of employment or employment relationship with \na temporary ag ency, precarious types of relationships where standard forms of protection against unfair treat\u00ad\nment are often difficult to apply. The concept of \u2018worker \u2019 also includes civil ser vants, public service employees, \nas well as any other persons working in the public sector.\n(39) Protection should also e xtend to categories of natural persons, who, whilst not being \u2018workers \u2019 wit hin the \nmeaning of Article 45(1)  TFEU, can play a key role in exposing breaches of Union law and may find themselves \nin a position of economic vulner ability in the context of their work-related activities. For instance, as regards \nproduct safety, suppliers are much closer to the source of information about possible unfair and illicit manufac\u00ad\nturing, import or distribution practices concerning unsafe products; and as regards the implementation of \nUnion funds, consultants providing their services are in a privileged position to draw attention to breaches they \nwitness. Suc\nh categories of persons, which include self-employed persons providing services, freelance workers, \ncontractors, subcontractors and suppliers, are typically subject to retaliation, which can take the form, for \ninstance, of early termination or cancellation of a contract f or services, a licence or per mit, loss of business, \nloss of income, coercion, intimidation or harassment, blacklisting or business boycotting or damage to their \nreputation. Shareholders and persons in managerial bodies can also suffer retaliation, for instance in financial \nterms or in the form of intimidation or harassment, blacklisting or damage to their reputation. Protection \nshould also be granted to persons whose work-based relationship has ended, and to candidates for employment \nor persons seeking to provide services to an organisation, who acquire information on breaches during the \nrecruitment process or another pre-contractual negotiation stage, and who could suffer retaliation, for instance \nin the form of negative employment references, blacklisting or business boycotting.\n(40) Effective whistleblower protection implies protecting also categories of persons who, whilst not relying on their \nw\nork-related activities economically, can nevertheless suffer retaliation for reporting breaches.

Effective protection of reporting persons as \na means of enhancing t he enforcement of Union law requires a broad def inition of retaliation, encompassing \nany act or omission occurring in a w ork-r elated cont ext and which causes them detriment. This Directive \nshould not, however, prevent employers from taking employment-related decisions which are not prompted by \nthe reporting or public disclosure.\n(45) Protection ag ainst retaliation as a m eans of saf eguarding freedom of expression and the freedom and pluralism \nof the media should be provided both to persons who report information about acts or omissions within an \norganisation (\u2018internal repor ting \u2019) or t o an outside authority (\u2018external repor ting \u2019) and t o persons who make \nsuch information available in the public domain, for instance, directly to the public through online platforms or \nsocial media, or to the media, elected officials, civil society organisations, trade unions, or professional and \nbusiness organisations.\n(46) Whistleblowers ar e, in particular, important sources for investigative journalists. Providing effective protection \nto whistleblowers from retaliation increases legal certainty for potential whistleblowers and thereby encourages \nwhistleblowing also through the media. In this respect, protection of whistleblowers as journalistic sources is \ncrucial for safeguarding the \u2018watchdog\u2019  role of investigative journalism in democratic societies.\n(47) For t he effective detection and prevention of breaches of Union law, it is vital that the relevant information \nreaches swiftly those closest to the source of the problem, most able to investigate and with powers to remedy \nit, where possible. As a principle, therefore, reporting persons should be encouraged to first use internal report\u00ad\ning c\nhannels and report to their employer, if such channels are available to them and can reasonably be \nexpected to work. That is the case, in particular, where reporting persons believe that the breach can be effec\u00ad\ntively addressed within the relevant organisation, and that there is no risk of retaliation. As a consequence, legal \nentities in t\nhe private and public sector should establish appropriate internal procedures for receiving and fol\u00ad\nlowing up on reports. Such encouragement also concerns cases where such channels were established without \nit being required by Union or national law. This principle should help foster a culture of good communication \nand cor\nporate social responsibility in organisations, whereby reporting persons are considered to significantly \ncontribute to self-correction and excellence within the organisation.\n(48) For leg al entities in the private sector, the obligation to establish internal reporting channels should be com\u00ad\nmensurate with their size and the level of risk their activities pose to the public interest. All enterprises having \n50 or more workers should be subject to the obligation to establish internal reporting channels, irrespective of \nthe nature of their activities, based on their obligation to collect VAT. Following an appropriate risk assessment, \nMember States could also require other enterprises to establish internal reporting channels in specific cases, for \ninstance due to the significant risks that may result from their activities.\n(49) This Dir ective should be without prejudice to Member States being able to encourage legal entities in the pri\u00ad\nvate sector with fewer than 50 workers to establish internal channels for reporting and follow-up, including by \nlaying down less prescriptive requirements for those channels than those laid down under this Directive, pro\u00ad\nvided that those requirements guarantee confidentiality and diligent follow-up.\n(50) The e xemption of small and micro enterprises from the obligation to establish internal reporting channels \nshould not apply to private enterprises which are obliged to establish internal reporting channels by virtue of \nUnion acts referred to in Parts I.B and II of the Annex.\n(51) It should be clear t hat, in the case of legal entities in the private sector that do not provide for internal report\u00ad\ning channels, reporting persons should be able to report externally to the competent authorities and such per\u00ad\nsons should enjoy the protection against retaliation provided by this Directive.\n(52) In order to ensure, in particular, that the public procurement rules in the public sector are respected, the obliga\u00ad\ntion\n to put in place internal reporting channels should apply to all contracting authorities and contracting enti\u00ad\nties, at local, regional and

Such third parties could be external reporting platform providers, external counsel, \nauditors, trade union representatives or employees' representatives.\n(55) Internal repor ting procedures should enable legal entities in the private sector to receive and investigate in full \nconfidentiality reports by the workers of the entity and of its subsidiaries or affiliates (\u2018the g roup\u2019), but also, t o \nany extent possible, by any of the group's agents and suppliers and by any persons who acquire information \nthrough their work-related activities with the entity and the group.\n(56) The c hoice of the most appropriate persons or departments within a legal entity in t he private sector to be \ndesignated as competent to receive and follow up on reports depends on the structure of the entity, but, in any \ncase, their function should be such as to ensure independence and absence of conflict of interest. In smaller \nentities, this function could be a dual function held b y a company of ficer well placed to report directly to the \norganisational head, such as a chief com pliance or human resources officer, an integrity officer, a legal or pr i\u00ad\nvacy officer, a chief financial officer, a chief audit executive or a member of the board.\n(57) In t he context of internal reporting, informing, as far as legally possible and in the most comprehensive way \npossible, the reporting person about the follow-up to the report is crucial for building trust in the effectiveness \nof the overall system of whistleblower protection and reduces the likelihood of further unnecessary reports or \npublic disclosures. The reporting person should be informed within a reasonable timefr ame about the action \nenvisaged or taken as follow-up to the report and the grounds for the choice of that follow-up. Follow-up could \ninclude, for instance, referral to other channels or procedures in the case of reports exclusively affecting individ\u00ad\nual rights of the reporting person, closure of the procedure based on lack of sufficient evidence or other \ngrounds, launch of an internal enquiry and, possibly, its findings and any measures taken to address the issue \nraised, referral to a competent authority for further investigation, insofar as such information would not preju\u00ad\ndice the internal enquiry or the investigation or affect the rights of the person concerned.

In all \ncases, persons reporting externally to the competent authorities and, where relevant, to institutions, bodies, \noffices or agencies of the Union should be protected. This Directive should also grant protection where Union \nor national law requires the reporting persons to report to the competent national authorities, for instance as \npart of their job duties and responsibilities or because the breach is a criminal of fence.\n(63) Lack of conf idence  in the effectiveness of reporting is one of the main factors discouraging potential whistle\u00ad\nblowers. Accordingly, there is a need to impose a  clear obligation on competent authorities to establish appro\u00ad\npr\niate external reporting channels, to diligently follow up on the reports received, and, within a reasonable \ntimeframe,\n give feedback to reporting persons.\n(64) It should be f or  the Member States to designate the authorities competent to receive information on breaches \nfalling within the scope of this Directive and give appropriate follow-up to the reports. Such competent author\u00ad\nities could be judicial authorities, regulatory or supervisory bodies competent in the specific areas concerned, \nor authorities of a m ore g eneral competence at a  central level within a  Member  State, law enforcement agen\u00ad\ncies,\n anticorruption bodies or ombudsmen.\n(65) As recipients of reports, the authorities designated as competent should have the necessary capacities and pow\u00ad\ners\n to ensure appropriate follow-up, including assessing the accuracy of the allegations made in the report and \naddressing the breaches reported by launching an internal enquiry, investigation, prosecution or action for \nrecovery of funds, or other appropriate remedial action, in accordance with their mandate. Alternatively, those \nauthorities should have the necessary powers to refer the report to another authority that should investigate the \nbreach reported, while ensuring that there is appropriate follow-up by such authority. In particular, where \nMember States wish to establish external reporting channels at a central level, for instance in the area of State \naid,\n Member States should put in place adequate safeguards in order to ensure that the requirements of inde\u00ad\npendence and autonomy laid down in this Directive are respected. The establishment of such external reporting \nchannels should not affect the powers of the Member States or of the Commission concerning supervision in \nthe field of State aid, nor should this Directive affect the exclusive power of the Commission as regards the \ndeclaration of compatibility of State aid measures in particular pursuant to Article 107(3)  TFEU. With regard to \nbreac hes\n of Articles 101  and 102 TFEU,  Member States should designate as competent authorities those \nreferred to in Article 35  of Council Regulation  (EC) No 1/2003  (35) without prejudice to the powers of the \nCommission\n in this area.\n(66) Competent aut hor ities should also give feedback to the reporting persons about the action envisaged or taken \nas follow-up, for instance, referral to another authority, closure of the procedure based on lack of sufficient \nevidence or other grounds, or launch of an investigation, and possibly its findings and any measures taken to \naddress the issue raised, as well as about the grounds for the choice of that follow-up.

This Directive \nshould not affect such external reporting channels and procedures, where they exist, but should ensure that \npersons reporting to institutions, bodies, offices or agencies of the Union benefit from common minimum \nstandards of protection throughout the Union.\n(70) To ensure the effectiveness of the procedures for following up on reports and addressing breaches of the Union \nrules\n concerned, Member States should be able to take measures to alleviate burdens for competent authorities \nresulting from reports of minor breaches of provisions falling within the scope of this Directive, repetitive \nreports or reports of breaches of ancillary provisions, for instance provisions on documentation or notification \nobligations. Such measures could consist in allowing competent authorities, after due assessment of the matter, \nto decide that a reported breach is clearly minor and does not require further follow-up pursuant to this Direc\u00ad\ntive,\n other than closure of the procedure. It should also be possible for Member States to allow competent \nauthorities to close the procedure regarding repetitive reports which do not contain any meaningful new infor\u00ad\nmation adding to a past report in respect of which the relevant procedures were concluded, unless new legal or \nf\nactual circumstances justify a different form of follow-up. Furthermore, Member States should be able to allow \ncompe\ntent authorities to prioritise the treatment of reports of serious breaches or breaches of essential provi\u00ad\nsions falling within the scope of this Directive in the event of high inflows of reports.\n(71) Where provided for under Union or national law, the competent authorities should refer cases or relevant infor\u00ad\nmation on breac hes\n to institutions, bodies, offices or agencies of the Union, including, for the purposes of this \nDirective, OLAF and the European Public Prosecutor Office (EPPO), without prejudice to the possibility for the \nreporting person to refer directly to such bodies, offices or agencies of the Union.\n(72) In man y policy areas falling within the material scope of this Directive, there are cooperation mechanisms \nt\nhrough which national competent authorities exchange information and carry out follow-up activities in rela\u00ad\ntion to breaches of Union rules with a cross-b or der dimension.

This could require that such channels are \nseparated from the general channels through which the competent authorities communicate with the public, \nsuch as normal public complaints systems or channels through which the competent authority communicates \ninternally and with third parties in its ordinary course of business.\n(74) Staff member s  of the competent authorities who are responsible for handling reports should be professionally \ntrained, including on applicable data protection rules, in order to handle reports and to ensure communication \nwith the reporting person, as well as to follow up on the report in a suitable manner.\n(75) Persons intending to report should be able to make an informed decision on whether, how and when to report. \nCom pe\ntent authorities should therefore provide clear and easily accessible information about the available \nreporting channels with competent authorities, about the applicable procedures and about the staff members \nresponsible for handling reports within those authorities. All information regarding reports should be transpar\u00ad\nent, easily understandable and reliable in order to promote and not deter reporting.\n(76) Member S tates should ensure that competent authorities have in place adequate protection procedures for the \npr\nocessing of reports and for the protection of the personal data of the persons referred to in the report. Such \nprocedures should ensure that the identity of every reporting person, person concerned, and third persons \nreferred to in the report, for example witnesses or colleagues, is protected at all stages of the procedure.\n(77) It is necessary that staff members of the competent authority who are responsible for handling reports and staff \nmember s\n of the competent authority who have the right of access to the information provided by a reporting \nperson\n comply with the duty of professional secrecy and confidentiality when transmitting the data both inside \nand outside the competent authority, including where a competent authority opens an investigation or an inter\u00ad\nnal\n enquiry or engages in enforcement activities in connection with the report.\n(78) The regular re vie w of the procedures of competent authorities and the exchange of good practices between \nthem should guarantee that those procedures are adequate and thus serving their purpose.\n(79) Persons making a public disclosur e  should qualify for protection in cases where, despite internal and external \nreporting, the breach remains unaddressed, for instance in cases where the breach was not appropriately \nassessed or investigated, or no appropriate remedial action was taken. The appropriateness of the follow-up \nshould be assessed according to objective criteria, linked to the obligation of the competent authorities to assess \nthe accuracy of the allegations and to put an end to any possible breach of Union law. The appropriateness of \nthe follow-up will thus depend on the circumstances of each case and of the nature of the rules that have been \nbreached. In particular, a decision by the authorities that a  breach was clearl y minor and no further follow-up, \nother than closure of the procedure, was required could constitute appropriate follow-up pursuant to this \nDirective.\n(80) Persons making a public disclosur e  directly should also qualify for protection in cases where they have reason\u00ad\nable grounds to believe that there is an imminent or manifest danger to the public interest, or a risk of irre\u00ad\nv\nersible damage, including harm to a person's  physical integrity.\n(81) Persons making a public disclosur e  directly should also qualify for protection where they have reasonable \ngrounds to believe that in the case of external reporting there is a risk of retaliation or there is a  low prospect \nof\n the breach being effectively addressed, due to the particular circumstances of the case, such as those where \nevidence could be concealed or destroyed or where an authority could be in collusion with the perpetrator of \nthe breach or involved in the breach.\n(82) Safeguarding the confidentiality of the identity of the reporting person during the reporting process and investi\u00ad\ngations\n triggered by the report is an essential ex-ante  measure to prevent retaliation.

Member States should ensure that relevant and accurate information in \nthat regard is provided in a way that is clear and easily accessible to the general public. Individual, impartial and \nconf\nidential advice, free of charge, should be available on, for example, whether the information in question is \ncovered by the applicable rules on whistleblower protection, which reporting channel might best be used and \nwhich alternative procedures are available in the event that the information is not covered by the applicable \nrules, so-called \u2018signposting \u2019. Access to such advice can help to ensure that reports are made through the appro\u00ad\npr\niate channels, in a responsible manner , and that breaches are detected in a timely manner or e ven prevented. \nSuch advice and information could be provided by an information centre or a single and independent adminis\u00ad\ntr\native authority. Member States could choose to extend such advice to legal counselling. Where such advice is \ngiven to reporting persons by civil society organisations which are bound by a duty of maintaining the confi\u00ad\ndential nature of the information received, Member States should ensure that such organisations do not suffer \nretaliation, for instance in the form of economic prejudice through a restriction on t heir access to funding or \nblacklisting that could impede the proper functioning of the organisation.\n(90) Competent aut horities should provide reporting persons with the support necessary for them to access protec\u00ad\ntion effectively. In particular, they should provide proof or other documentation required to confirm to other \nauthorities or courts that external reporting has taken place. Under certain national frameworks and in certain \ncases, reporting persons may benefit from forms of certification of the fact that they meet the conditions of the \napplicable rules. Notwithstanding such possibilities, they should have effective access to judicial review, whereby \nit is for the courts to decide, based on all the individual circumstances of the case, whether they meet the \nconditions of the applicable rules.\n(91) It should no t be possible to rely on individuals' legal or contractual obligations, such as loyalty clauses in con\u00ad\ntracts or confidentiality or non-disclosure agreements, so as to preclude reporting, to deny protection or to \npenalise reporting persons for having reported information on breaches or made a public disclosure wher e \nproviding the information falling within the scope of such clauses and agreements is necessary for revealing the \nbreach. Where those conditions are met, reporting persons should not incur any kind of liability, be it civil, \ncriminal, administrative or employment-related. It is appropriate that there be protection from liability for the \nreporting or public disclosure under this Directive of information in respect of which the reporting person had \nreasonable grounds to believe that reporting or public disclosure was necessary to reveal a breach pur suant to \nthis Directive. Such protection should not extend to superfluous information that the person revealed without \nhaving such reasonable grounds.\n(92) Where reporting persons lawfully acquire or obtain access to the information on breaches reported or the doc\u00ad\numents\n containing that information, they should enjoy immunity from liability. This should apply both in cases \nwhere reporting persons reveal the content of documents to which they have lawful access as well as in cases \nwhere they make copies of such documents or remove them from the premises of the organisation where they \nare employed, in breach of contractual or other clauses stipulating that the relevant documents are the property \nof the organisation. The reporting persons should also enjoy immunity from liability in cases where the acquisi\u00ad\ntion of or access to the relevant information or documents raises an issue of civil, administrative or labour-\nrelated liability. Examples would be cases where the reporting persons acquired the information by accessing \nthe emails of a co-w orker or f iles which they normally do not use within the scope of their work, by taking \npictures of the premises of the organisation or by accessing locations they do not usually have access to.

The appropriate remedy in each case should be \ndetermined by the kind of retaliation suffered, and the damage caused in such cases should be compensated in \nfull in accordance with national law. The appropriate remedy could take the form of actions for reinstatement, \nfor instance, in the event of dismissal, transfer or demotion, or of withholding of training or promotion, or for \nrestoration of a cancelled permit, licence or contract; compensation for actual and future financial losses, for \ne\nxample for lost past wages, but also for future loss of income, costs linked to a change of occupation; and \ncompensation\n for other economic damage, such as legal expenses and costs of medical treatment, and for intan\u00ad\ngible damage such as pain and suffering.\n(95) While the types of legal action may vary between legal systems, they should ensure that compensation or repa\u00ad\nration\n is real and effective, in a way which is proportionate to the detriment suffered and is dissuasive. Of \nr\nelevance in this context are the Principles of the European Pillar of Social Rights, in particular Principle 7 \naccording to which \u2018Prior to any dismissal, workers have the right to be informed of the reasons and be granted \na\n reasonable period of notice. They have the right to access to effective and impartial dispute resolution and, in \ncase\n of unjustified dismissal, a right t o redress, including adequate compensation. \u2019 . The remedies established  at \nnational level should not discourage potential future whistleblowers. For instance, providing for compensation \nas an alternative to reinstatement in the event of dismissal might give rise to a systematic practice, in particular \nby\n larger organisations, thus having a dissuasive effect on future whis tleblowers.\n(96) Of par ticular importance for reporting persons are interim remedies pending the resolution of legal proceed\u00ad\nings\n that can be protracted. Particularly, actions of interim relief, as provided for under national law, should also \nbe available to reporting persons in order to stop threats, attempts or continuing acts of retaliation, such as \nharassment or to prevent forms of retaliation, such as dismissal, which might be difficult to reverse after the \nlapse of lengthy periods and which can ruin the individual financially, a perspective which  can seriously dis\u00ad\ncourage potential whistleblowers.\n(97) Action t aken against reporting persons outside the work-related context, through proceedings, for instance, \nrelat\ned to defamation, breach of copyright, trade secrets, confidentiality and personal data protection, can also \npose a serious deterrent to whistleblowing. In such proceedings, reporting persons should be able to rely on \nha\nving reported breaches or made a public disclosure  in accordance with this Directive as a defence, provided \nt\nhat the information reported or publicly disclosed was necessary to reveal the breach.

The right to the prote ction of personal \ndata is not an absolute right ; it must be considered in relation to its function in society and be balanced against \nother fundamental rights, in accordance with the principle of propor tionality . This Regulation respects all \nfundamental rights and obser ves the freedoms and principles recognised in the Char ter as enshr ined in the \nTreaties, in particular the respect for private and family life, home and communications, the protection of \npersonal data, freedom of thought, conscience and religion, freedom of expression and information, freedom to \nconduct a business, the right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial, and cultural, religious and linguistic \ndiversity . \n(5)  The economic and social integration resulting from the functioning of the intern al mark et has led to a substantial \nincrease in cross-border flows of personal data. The exchange of personal data between public and private actor s, \nincluding natural persons, associations and under takings across the Union has increased. National author ities in \nthe Member State s are being called upon by Union law to cooperate and exchange personal data so as to be able \nto perform their duties or carry out tasks on behalf of an author ity in another Member State . \n(6)  Rapid technological developments and globalisation have brought new challenges for the protection of personal \ndata. The scale of the collection and shar ing of personal data has increased signif icantly . Techn ology allows both \nprivate companies and public author ities to mak e use of personal data on an unprecedented scale in order to \npursue their activities. Natural persons increasing ly mak e personal information available publicly and globally . \nTechnology has transf ormed both the econom y and social life, and should further facilitat e the free flow of \npersonal data within the Union and the transfer to third countr ies and international orga nisations, while ensur ing \na high level of the protection of personal data. \n(7)  Those developments require a strong and more coherent data prot ection framew ork in the Union, back ed by \nstrong enforcement, given the impor tance of creating the trust that will allow the digital econom y to develop \nacross the internal mark et. Natural persons should have control of their own personal data. Legal and practical \ncertainty for natural persons, economic operat ors and public author ities should be enhanced. \n(8)  Where this Regulation provides for specific ations or restr ictions of its rules by Member State law, Member States \nmay, as far as necessar y for coherence and for making the national provisions compreh ensible to the persons to \nwhom they apply , incor porate elements of this Regulation into their national law. \n(9)  The objectives and principles of Directive 95/46/EC remain sound, but it has not prevente d fragmentation in the \nimplementation of data protection across the Union, legal uncer tainty or a widespread public percep tion that \nthere are signif icant risks to the protection of natural persons, in particular with regar d to online activity . \nDifferences in the level of prote ction of the rights and freedoms of natural persons, in particular the right to the \nprot ection of personal data, with regard to the processing of personal data in the Member States may prevent the \nfree flow of personal data throughout the Union. Those diffe rences may theref ore constitute an obstacle to the \npursuit of economic activities at the level of the Union, distor t competition and impede author ities in the \ndisc harge of their responsibilities under Union law. Such a differ ence in levels of protection is due to the \nexisten ce of differ ences in the implementation and application of Directive 95/46/EC. \n(10)  In order to ensure a consistent and high level of prot ection of natural persons and to remo ve the obstacles to \nflows of personal data within the Union, the level of prot ection of the rights and freedoms of natural persons \nwith regar d to the processing of such data should be equivalent in all Member States.

In order to \ndetermine whether such a controller or processor is offer ing goods or services to data subjects who are in the \nUnion, it should be ascer tained whether it is apparent that the controller or processor envisages offer ing services \nto data subjects in one or more Member States in the Union. Whereas the mere accessibility of the controller's, \nprocessor's or an interm ediar y's website in the Union, of an email address or of other contact details, or the use \nof a language generally used in the third countr y where the controller is established, is insufficient to ascer tain \nsuch intenti on, factors such as the use of a language or a currency general ly used in one or more Member States \nwith the possibility of order ing goods and services in that other languag e, or the mentioning of custome rs or \nusers who are in the Union, may make it apparent that the controller envisages offer ing goods or services to data \nsubjects in the Union. \n(24)  The processing of personal data of data subjects who are in the Union by a controller or processor not \nestablished in the Union should also be subject to this Regulation when it is related to the monitori ng of the \nbeha viour of such data subjects in so far as their behavi our takes place within the Union. In order to determine \nwhether a processing activity can be considered to monit or the beha viour of data subjects, it should be \nascer tained whether natural persons are tracked on the intern et including potential subsequent use of personal \ndata processing techniques which consist of prof iling a natural person, particularly in order to take decisions \nconcer ning her or him or for analysing or predicting her or his personal preferences, beha viours and attitudes. \n(25)  Where Member State law applies by virtue of public international law, this Regulation should also apply to a \ncontroller not established in the Union, such as in a Member State 's diplomatic mission or consular post. \n(26)  The principles of data prote ction should apply to any information concer ning an identif ied or identifiable natural \nperson. Personal data which have undergone pseudon ymisation, whic h could be attributed to a natural person by \nthe use of additional information should be considered to be information on an identif iable natural person. To \ndetermine whether a natural person is identifiable, account should be taken of all the means reasonably likely to \nbe used, such as sing ling out, either by the controller or by another person to identify the natural person directly \nor indirectly . To ascer tain whether means are reasonably likely to be used to identify the natural person, account \nshould be taken of all objective factors, such as the costs of and the amount of time required for identif ication, \ntaking into consideration the available technology at the time of the processing and technological developments. \nThe principles of data protection should theref ore not apply to anonymous information, namely information \nwhic h does not relate to an identified or identif iable natural person or to personal data rendered anonym ous in \nsuch a manner that the data subject is not or no long er identifiable.

Some types of processing may serve both impor tant grounds \nof public interest and the vital inter ests of the data subject as for instance when processing is necessar y for \nhumanitar ian purposes, including for monitori ng epidemics and their spread or in situations of humanitar ian \nemerg encies, in particular in situations of natural and man-made disasters. \n(47)  The legitimate inter ests of a controller , including those of a controller to which the personal data may be \ndisclosed, or of a third party, may provide a legal basis for processing, provided that the interests or the \nfundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject are not overriding, taking into consideration the reasonable \nexpectations of data subjects based on their relationship with the controller . Such legitimate interest could exist \nfor example where there is a relevant and appropr iate relationship between the data subject and the controller in \nsituations such as where the data subject is a client or in the service of the controller . At any rate the existen ce of \na legitimate interest would need careful assessment including whether a data subject can reasonably expect at the \ntime and in the cont ext of the collection of the personal data that processing for that purpose may take place. \nThe inter ests and fundamental rights of the data subject could in particular override the inter est of the data \ncontroller where personal data are processed in circumstances where data subjects do not reasonably expect \nfurther processing. Given that it is for the legislator to provide by law for the legal basis for public author ities to \nprocess personal data, that legal basis should not apply to the processing by public author ities in the \nperforma nce of their tasks. The processing of personal data strictly necessar y for the purposes of preventing \nfraud also constitutes a legitimate interest of the data controller concer ned.
