(a)  In this section, “breach of system security” means unauthorized acquisition of computerized 
data that compromises the security, confidentiality, or integrity of sensitive personal information 
maintained by a person, including data that is encrypted if the person accessing the data has the 
key required to decrypt the data. Good faith acquisition of sensitive personal information by an 
employee or agent of the perso n for the purposes of the person is not a breach of system security 
unless the person uses or discloses the sensitive personal information in an unauthorized manner.  
(b)  A person who conducts business in this state and owns or licenses computerized data t hat 
includes sensitive personal information shall disclose any breach of system security, after 
discovering or receiving notification of the breach, to any individual whose sensitive personal 
information was, or is reasonably believed to have been, acquire d by an unauthorized person. The 
disclosure shall be made without unreasonable delay and in each case not later than the 60th day 
after the date on which the person determines that the breach occurred, except as provided by 
Subsection (d) or as necessary t o determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable 
integrity of the data system.  
(b-1)If the individual whose sensitive personal information was or is reasonably believed to have 
been acquired by an unauthorized person is a resident of a state that requires a person described by 
Subsection (b) to provide notice of a breach of system security, the notice of the breach of system 
security required under Subsection (b) may be provided under that state’s law or under Subsection 
(b). 
(c)  Any person w ho maintains computerized data that includes sensitive personal information not 
owned by the person shall notify the owner or license holder of the information of any breach of 
system security immediately after discovering the breach, if the sensitive pers onal information 
was, or is reasonably believed to have been, acquired by an unauthorized person.  
(d)  A person may delay providing notice as required by Subsection (b) or (c) at the request of a 
law enforcement agency that determines that the notification  will impede a criminal investigation. Page 2 of 3 
Tex. Bus. & Com. Code § 521.053

(2)  conspicuous posting of the notice on the person’s website; or  
(3)  notice published in or broadcast on major statewide media.  
(g)  Notwithstanding Subsection (e), a person who maintains  the person’s own notification 
procedures as part of an information security policy for the treatment of sensitive personal 
information that complies with the timing requirements for notice under this section complies with 
this section if the person notifi es affected persons in accordance with that policy.  
(h)  If a person is required by this section to notify at one time more than 10,000 persons of a 
breach of system security, the person shall also notify each consumer reporting agency, as defined 
by 15 U. S.C. Section 1681a, that maintains files on consumers on a nationwide basis, of the 
timing, distribution, and content of the notices. The person shall provide the notice required by this 
subsection without unreasonable delay.  
(i)  A person who is required to disclose or provide notification of a breach of system security 
under this section shall notify the attorney general of that breach as soon as practicable and not 
later than the 30th day after the date on which the person determines that the breach occu rred if the

(2)  the number of residents of this state affected by the breach at  the time of notification;                       
                     
(3)  the number of affected residents that have been sent a disclosure of the breach by mail or

(6)  information regarding whether law enforcement is engaged in investigating the breach.

excluding any sensitive personal information that may have been reported to the attorney 
general under that subsection, any information that may compromise a data system’s security, 
and any other information  reported to the attorney general that is made confidential by law. 
The attorney general shall:                         
(A)  update the listing not later than the 30th day after the date the attorney general
