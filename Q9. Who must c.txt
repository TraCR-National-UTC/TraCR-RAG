3.  Electronic notice; or  
4.  Substitute notice, if the individual or the entity required to provide notice demonstrates that 
the cost of providing notice will exceed $50,000, the affected class of Virginia residents to be

(1)  The incident in general terms;  
(2)  The type of personal information that was subject to the unauthorized access and
