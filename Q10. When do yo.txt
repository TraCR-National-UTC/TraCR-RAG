information was, or the covered entity reasonably believes to have been, accessed as a result of

information has been accessed. Such a determination must be documented in writing and 
maintained for at  least 5 years. The covered entity shall provide the written determination to

have been accessed as a part of the breach of security.

breach of security and the personal information that the covered entity maintained about 
the individual.  
(f)  A covered entity required to provide notice to an individual may prov ide substitute notice 
in lieu of direct notice if such direct notice is not feasible because the cost of providing notice 
would exceed $250,000, because the affected individuals exceed 500,000 persons, or because 
the covered entity does not have an e -mail address or mailing address for the affected 
individuals. Such substitute notice shall include the following:  
1.  A conspicuous notice on the Internet website of the covered entity if the covered entity 
maintains a website; and

notice requirement in this subsection if the covered entity notifies affected individuals in 
accordance with the rules, regulations, procedures, or guidelines established by the primary or 
functional federal regulator  in the event of a breach of security. Under this paragraph, a 
covered entity that timely provides a copy of such notice to the department is deemed to be in 
compliance with the notice requirement in subsection (3).  
(5) Notice to credit reporting agencies.    If a covered entity discovers circumstances requiring 
notice pursuant to this section of more than 1,000 individuals at a single time, the covered entity 
shall also notify, without unreasonable delay, all consumer reporting agencies that compile and 
maintain files on consumers on a nationwide basis, as defined in the Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 
U.S.C. s. 1681a(p), of the timing, distribution, and content of the notices.  
(6) Notice by third -party agents; duties of third -party agents; notice by agents.   
(a)  In the event of a breach of security of a system maintained by a third -party agent, such 
third -party agent shall notify the covered entity of the breach of security as expeditiously as 
practicable, but no later than 10 days following the determinatio n of the breach of security or 
reason to believe the breach occurred. Upon receiving notice from a third -party agent, a 
covered entity shall provide notices required under subsections (3) and (4). A third -party agent 
shall provide a covered entity with all  information that the covered entity needs to comply with 
its notice requirements.  Page 5 of 6 
Fla. Stat. § 501.171  
   (b)  An agent may provide notice as required under subsections (3) and (4) on behalf of the 
covered entity; however, an agent’s failure to provide proper notice shall be dee med a 
violation of this section against the covered entity.  
(7) Annual report.   By February 1 of each year, the department shall submit a report to the 
President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives describing the nature of 
any re ported breaches of security by governmental entities or third -party agents of governmental 
entities in the preceding calendar year along with recommendations for security improvements. 
The report shall identify any governmental entity that has violated any  of the applicable 
requirements in subsections (2) -(6) in the preceding calendar year.  
(8) Requirements for disposal of customer records.   Each covered entity or third -party agent 
shall take all reasonable measures to dispose, or arrange for the disposal,  of customer records 
containing personal information within its custody or control when the records are no longer to be 
retained. Such disposal shall involve shredding, erasing, or otherwise modifying the personal 
information in the records to make it unre adable or undecipherable through any means.  
(9) Enforcement.   
(a)  A violation of this section shall be treated as an unfair or deceptive trade practice in any 
action brought by the department under s. 501.207 against a covered entity or third -party 
agent.  
(b)  In addition to the remedies provided for in paragraph (a), a covered entity that violates 
subsection (3) or subsection (4) shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $500,000, as 
follows:  
1.  In the amount of $1,000 for each day up to the first 30 days following any violation of
